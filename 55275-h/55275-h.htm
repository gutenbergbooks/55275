<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The writing of history requires three operations:
(I) The collection of facts; (II) The classification
and arrangement of facts; (III) The
presentation and discussion of facts. I have
collected the facts related in this book from every source
open to me. These sources may be divided into two
groups: (1) Published and (2) unpublished, matter.
The published matter includes (a) official records;
(b) books, and (c) magazine or other ephemeral articles.
The unpublished matter includes (a) letters and (b)
verbal communications.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have made use of all these sources of information in
gathering the facts. A list of some of the printed authorities
consulted follows this preface. In addition
thereto, I beg to acknowledge written communications
from the following American Army officers, all now on
the retired list except Colonels Godfrey and Brainard
and Captain Livermore:—Lieutenant-General Nelson A.
Miles; Major-General Robert P. Hughes; Brigadier-Generals
Henry B. Carrington, George A. Forsyth,
Louis H. Carpenter, Anson Mills, Charles A. Woodruff
and Theo. F. Rodenbough; Colonel Edward E. S. Godfrey,
commanding the Ninth Cavalry; Colonel David
L. Brainard, Commissary of Subsistence; Lieutenant-Colonel
Samuel M. Horton; Captains Henry R. Lemly,
Francis M. Gibson, Nathan S. Jarvis, George E. Albee
and R. L. Livermore, Tenth Cavalry; and the following
civilians: President E. Benjamin Andrews; Doctors
T. E. Oertel and D. D. Thompson; Messrs. W. Kent
Thomas, Sigmund Schlesinger, Edward Esmonde,
Phineas Towne, W. R. E. Collins, Hugh M. Johnson,
Herbert Myrick, R. J. Smyth, William E. Morris,
Nicholas E. Boyd, Theo. W. Goldin and Arthur Chapman;
Mrs. Guy V. Henry and Mrs. James Powell.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these letters I have gathered much
information in conversation with officers and others,
not only recently but during many years spent in the
West, where I was a frequent guest at army posts, in
frontier towns, and at some of the Indian reservations.
I knew many of the participants in the stirring incidents
and heard the fascinating stories from their own
lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chapters of the Fort Phil Kearney series have
been read and corrected as to matters of fact by General
Carrington and Colonel Horton; those referring to the
defense of Beecher’s Island, by General Forsyth; those
describing the relief of Forsyth and the fight on the
Beaver, by General Carpenter; those relating to the
Little Big Horn campaign, by General Woodruff and
Colonel Godfrey, and the account of the affair at Slim
Buttes and the death of American Horse, by General
Mills. All of these gentlemen gave me interesting details,
anecdotes, etc., besides answering all my inquiries.
Several of them put their private papers at my disposal.
To Colonel Godfrey I am especially indebted for much
interesting matter on the Little Big Horn campaign,
and to Captain Gibson for the use of his unprinted account
of the Battle of the Washita. The Office of the
Secretary of War has been most kind in answering questions
and furnishing information not otherwise procurable.
Mr. W. H. Holmes, Chief of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, has decided
all questions as to the proper spelling of Indian names,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
and has given me the Indian equivalents of the names
of prominent chiefs, as Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the papers following are original contributions
especially prepared for this book. The authors
of these papers are indicated hereafter. For all expressions
of opinion, for all comments, notes and inferences,
not specifically attributed to somebody else,
I alone am responsible.</p>

<p class='c000'>To all who have aided me to make this series authoritative
and definitive, my most grateful thanks are hereby
heartily expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I trust that in thus striving to preserve the records of
those stirring times I have done history and posterity
a service. The majority of those who fought on the
plains have passed away. Many of the surviving participants
in the adventures described are growing old.
In a short time it would have been impossible to have
secured the information here presented unless some
one else had gone about it as I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>With intervals devoted to other duties, I have been
over a year and a half engaged in this congenial task.
I have written literally hundreds of letters, to learn, or
to verify, a fact, an incident, or a conclusion. It is interesting
to call attention to the fact that information
has been freely and generously given to me from every
source whence I have asked it save three, one of which
is noted in the appendix.</p>

<p class='c000'>The series of historical books of which this forms the
fourth seems to have won a permanent place for itself.
The number of copies which found a welcome last year
was greater than the number of the year before, although
there was no new volume issued last fall to call
renewed attention to the series. These books are generally
spoken of by the title of the first published,
“American Fights and Fighters.” It has been deemed
proper, therefore, to adopt that name, which is sufficiently
explicit and descriptive, as the generic name of
the series. Hereafter all the books that have appeared,
and those that are yet to appear in this series, will bear
that general name, with the addition of a distinctive subtitle
in each instance. The covers of the earlier books,
accordingly, have been changed to read as follows:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>1. American Fights and Fighters, Colonial.
    </li>
    <li>2. American Fights and Fighters, Revolutionary—1812.
    </li>
    <li>3. American Fights and Fighters, Border.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c000'>As I have stated, it is my hope to continue this series
of books until I have covered all the wars that have been
fought upon the American Continent since Columbus’s
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far as the American people are concerned—save
in the case of the Mexican War—their struggles
have generally been to establish a broader, nobler conception
of human freedom. I would not have any one
gather from this that our dealings with the Indian invariably
have been characterized by that honesty and
honor which should be at the base of every national undertaking—far
from it! In this book, without growing
sentimental, I have endeavored to be fair to the Indians;
as in previous books, I have tried to deal justly by any
and every enemy.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> To be honest and to be fair—these
things are of prime importance in writing history and in
living life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am now at work on two other volumes, a book on
“South American Fights and Fighters” and a second
volume of “Indian Fights and Fighters.” In this proposed
Indian book I shall take up the further struggles of
the United States with the Indians of the Northwest,
notably Chief Joseph’s splendid migration with his Nez-Percés,
the dash of the Cheyennes for freedom, Captain
Jack and the Modoc War, the Ute War, the last outbreak
of the Sioux, and various other affairs in the
Northwest. Thereafter I contemplate a third book
dealing with Arizona and the Apache.</p>

<p class='c000'>I take this opportunity of asking every individual,
soldier or civilian, who participated in any of these campaigns
or battles, who has any material bearing upon
them, and who is willing to allow me to look over it,
kindly to send it to me in care of the publishers of this
book, as soon as possible, as I expect to issue the next
volume of the series next fall. Any such material will
be carefully preserved and returned by express in good
order, and due credit—also a copy of the book!—will
be given for any which may be of use to me in the
next book, as in this one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is getting late, as I said, to write the history of some
of these things, and I am actuated by an earnest desire
to preserve the records before it is too late. Who will
help me? Since I began writing history I have learned
to disregard no authority, however humble, and to
neglect no source of information, however obscure it
may appear to a casual inspection. Therefore send me
what you have or can prepare, and allow me to judge of
its value.</p>

<p class='c000'>American people are usually more familiar with the
story of other peoples than with their own history. How
often have I heard the charge made that there is nothing
romantic or interesting in American history. I do
not see how any one could read even the chapter headings
of a book like this and say a thing like that. Where
are there more splendid stories of dauntless heroism, of
subtle strategy, of brilliant tactics, of fierce fighting,
than are contained in these pages? I may have told
them indifferently and may be the subject of just criticism
therefor, but the stories at least are there. They
speak for themselves. I could not spoil them if I tried.
The facts ring like a trumpet-call to American manhood,

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Almost every author has a different way of spelling the names of the sub-tribes of

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For instance:—Every time a body of troops engages in a fight with Indians and
the troops are outnumbered, or caught at a disadvantage, and the battle is continued
until the troops are slaughtered, such an affair is popularly called a “massacre”; as
“The Fetterman Massacre,” “The Custer Massacre.” I believe this to be an unwarranted
use of the term. Fetterman and Custer attacked the Indians and fought desperately
until they and their men were all killed. I call that a “battle” not a “massacre.”
When an Indian war party raided a settlement or overwhelmed a train, or murdered
children and women, that, I think, was a “massacre”; but these two instances
were not. Consequently, I have carefully refrained from making use of that term in this
book, except where it is justifiable. The reader may not agree with me in this position,
but I would like to ask if any one ever heard of the “Massacre of Thermopylæ”? The
Greeks fought there until all, save one, were killed. The results there were exactly
those of the Fetterman affair and the battle of the Little Big Horn, but I have yet to
read in history that the Persians “massacred” the Greeks in that famous pass. What
is sauce for the Persians is sauce for the Red Men as well.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>It will be noticed that this book differs from
others of the <span class='sc'>American Fights and Fighters
Series</span>, and especially its immediate predecessor,
“Indian Fights and Fighters,” in that I am not
the author of all or most of it. In response to a request
for contributions from participants in the Modoc
and Nez Percé wars, numerous papers were submitted,
all of such high value, not only from an historic
but from a literary point of view as well, that I had not
the presumption to rewrite them myself—not even the
proverbial assurance of the historian would warrant that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore, I have contented myself with writing a
general and comprehensive account of each of the two
wars considered, leaving to the actors themselves the
telling in full of the detailed story of the splendid achievements
in which they were making history. I can affirm,
therefore, that never before has there been included in
a single volume such a remarkable and interesting collection
of personal experiences in our Indian Wars as
in this book.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as I admire the doers of the deeds so, also, do I
admire the tellers of the tales. Their modesty, their
restraint, their habit of relating adventures which stir
the blood and thrill the soul as a mere matter of course,—“all
in the day’s work”—enkindles my enthusiasm.
And how graphically these old soldiers wield their
pens! What good story tellers they are!</p>

<p class='c000'>And what different sorts and conditions of men are
here represented! Major-generals and scouts, captains
and sergeants, frontiersmen and troopers, soldiers and
civilians, to say nothing of an Indian chief and a bishop,
have all said their say in their own way. The reader will
be glad, I know, that I have permitted these men, like
Paul, to speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole book constitutes a trumpet call to American
manhood, and honor, and courage, and that I
believe to be true of the whole series.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Army of the United States is sometimes slandered.
A case in point is now in mind. The chief official of a
city of no little prominence, who is also an author and a
publicist of national repute, has recently put forth a
bitter diatribe against our soldiers. Such a book as this
refutes these unfounded accusations. The Army is not
perfect—neither is the Church!—but not only man
for man, but also as an organization it is the equal of
any, and the superior of most, of the armies of the world!
And I am sure that no one can get a much better training
for the battle of life that he gets in the peace loving,
hard working, honor seeking, duty following, never
failing, hard fighting service of the United States—on
sea or shore. I have been in both, worn the Army
and also the Navy blue, and I know. We all deprecate
the necessity for armies, but if we must have them, let us
thank God for an army like that of our beloved country.
I am glad to express this my deliberate and matured
conviction, begot of much study, wide observation,
and ripe experience.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>I. The Field and the Fighters</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Since the United States began to be there never
was such a post as Fort Philip Kearney, commonly
called Fort Phil Kearney.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> From its establishment,
in 1866, to its abandonment, some two
years later, it was practically in a state of siege. I do
not mean that it was beleaguered by the Indians in any
formal, persistent investment, but it was so constantly
and so closely observed by war parties, hidden
in the adjacent woods and the mountain passes, that
there was little safety outside its stockade for anything
less than a company of infantry or a troop of cavalry;
and not always, as we shall see, for those.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rarely in the history of the Indian wars of the United
States have the Indians, no matter how preponderant
in force, conducted a regular siege, Pontiac’s investment
of Detroit being almost unique in that particular. But
they literally surrounded Fort Phil Kearney at all times.
Nothing escaped their observation, and no opportunity
to harass and to cut off detached parties of the garrison,
to stampede the herds, or to attack the wagon trains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>was allowed to pass by. Not a stick of timber could
be cut, not an acre of grass mowed, except under heavy
guard. Herds of beef cattle, the horses for the cavalry
and mounted infantry, the mules for the supply wagons,
could not graze, even under the walls of the fort, without
protection. The country teemed with game.
Hunting parties were absolutely forbidden. To take a
stroll outside the stockade on a summer evening was to
invite death, or worse if the stroller happened to be a
woman. There was no certainty about the attacks, except
an assurance that one was always due at any given
moment. As old James Bridger, a veteran plainsman
and fur trader, a scout whose fame is scarcely less than
that of Kit Carson, and the confidential companion adviser
of Carrington in 1866, was wont to say to him:
“Whar you don’t see no Injuns thar they’re sartin to be
thickest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking at random two average months in the two
different years during which the post was maintained,
one in the summer, another in the fall, I find that there
were fifteen separate and distinct attacks in one and
twenty in the other. In many of these, in most, in fact,
one or more men were killed and a greater number
wounded. Not a wagon train bound for Montana
could pass up the Bozeman trail, which ran under the
walls of the fort, and for the protection of which it had
been established, without being attacked again and
again. Only the most watchful prudence, the most
skilful management, and the most determined valor,
prevented the annihilation of successive parties of emigrants
seeking the new and inviting land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The war with the Indians was about the ownership of
territory, as most of our Indian wars have been. Indeed,
that statement is true of most of the wars of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>world. The strong have ever sought to take from the
weak. The westward-moving tide of civilization had at
last pressed back from the Missouri and the Mississippi
the Sioux and their allies, the Cheyennes, the largest
and most famous of the several great groups of Indians
who have disputed the advance of the white man since
the days of Columbus, saving perhaps the Creeks and
the Iroquois.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vast expanse of territory west of the hundredth
meridian, extending from the Red River to the British
Columbia boundary line, was at the time practically devoid
of white settlements, except at Denver and Salt
Lake, until the Montana towns were reached in the
northwest.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It is a great sweep of land which comprises
every variety of climate and soil. The huge Big
Horn Mountains severed that immense domain. The
Sweet Water Country and all east of the Wind River
Range, including South Pass and the region west of the
great bend of the North Platte, had its prairies and fertile
valleys. Just north of the Big Horn Mountain
Range, which took in the territory which formed the
most direct route to Central Montana, and the occupation
of which was the real objective of Carrington’s
expedition in the spring of 1866, was the most precious
section, controlled by tribes jealous of any intrusion by
the whites.</p>

<p class='c000'>All along the Yellowstone and its tributaries, in spite
of the frequent “<em>Mauvaises Terres</em>,” or “bad lands,”
of apparent volcanic origin, the whole country was
threaded with clear streams from the Big Horn Range.
The valleys of these were luxuriant in their natural
products and their promise. Enormous herds of buffalo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>roamed the plains, affording the Indian nearly everything
required for his support. The mountains abounded
with bear, deer and other game in great variety.
The many rivers which traversed the territory teemed
with fish, the valleys which they watered were abundantly
fertile for the growing of the few crops which the
Indian found necessary for his support. The land was
desirable naturally and attracted the attention of the
settlers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be gainsaid that the Indians enjoyed a quasi-legal
title to this land. But if a comparatively small
group of nomadic and savage tribes insists upon reserving
a great body of land for a mere hunting ground,
using as a game preserve that which, in a civilized region,
would easily support a great agricultural and urban
population of industrious citizens seeking relief
from the crowded and confined conditions of older communities,
what are you going to do about it? Experience
has shown that in spite of treaties, purchases and
other peaceful means of obtaining it, there is always
bound to be a contest about that land. The rights of
savagery have been compelled to yield to the demands
of civilization, ethics to the contrary notwithstanding.
And it will always be so, sad though it may seem to
many.</p>

<p class='c000'>The close of the Civil War threw many soldiers out
of employment. After four years of active campaigning
they could not settle down to the humdrum life
of village and country again. With a natural spirit of
restlessness they gathered their families, loaded their
few household belongings into wagons, and in parties
of varying sizes made their way westward. Railroads
began to push iron feelers across the territory. Engineers
and road builders, as well as emigrants, demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the protection of the government. At first most of the
settlers merely wished to pass through the country and
settle in the fair lands upon the other side, but the fertility
and beauty that met their eyes on every hand
irresistibly invited settlement on the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time there were four great routes of transcontinental
travel in use: southward over the famous Santa
Fé trail; westward over the Kansas trail to Denver;
westward on the Oregon trail through Nebraska and
Salt Lake City to California and Oregon; northwestward
on the Bozeman trail through Wyoming to Montana.
The Union Pacific road was building along the Oregon
trail, the Kansas Pacific along the Kansas trail to
Denver, while the great Santa Fé system was not yet
dreamed of.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroads being in operation for short distances,
the only method of transportation was in the huge
Conestoga wagon, or prairie schooner which, with its
canvas top raking upward fore and aft over a capacious
wagon box, looked not unlike the hull of the boat from
which it took its name. These wagons were drawn by
four or six mules—sometimes by oxen, known as “bull
teams”—and, stores there being none, carried everything
that a settler was apt to need in the new land,
including the indispensable wife and children.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am concerned in this article only with the Bozeman
or Montana trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1866 Government Commissioners at Fort
Laramie, Nebraska, were negotiating a treaty with the
Sioux and Northern Cheyennes to secure the right of
way for emigrants through that territory which, by the
Harney-Sanborne treaty, had been conceded to them in
1865. Red Cloud, an Oglala Sioux, the foremost of
the young warriors, led the objectors to the treaty, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to the point of fighting, and opposed the more conservative
chiefs who deprecated war as eventually fatal to
all their territorial claims. During this council, to anticipate
later events, Carrington, then approaching with
troops, arrived in advance, dismounted, and was introduced
to the members of the council. Red Cloud, noticing
his shoulder straps, hotly denounced him as the
“White Eagle” who had come to steal the road before
the Indian said yes or no. In full view of the mass of
Indians who occupied the parade ground he sprang
from the platform under the shelter of pine boughs,
struck his tepees and went on the war-path. A telegram
by Carrington advising suspension of his march until
the council came to some agreement was negatived,
and although Sunday he pushed forward nine miles
beyond the fort before sunset.</p>

<p class='c000'>One stipulation upon which the United States insisted
was the establishment of military posts to guard
the trail, without which it was felt the treaty would
amount to nothing. The Brulé Sioux, under the lead
of Spotted Tail, Standing Elk and others, favored the
concession, and ever after remained faithful to the
whites. The older chiefs of other Sioux bands, in spite
of Red Cloud’s defection and departure, remained in
council for some days and, although sullen in manner
and noisy in protests, finally accepted valuable gifts and
indemnities and so far satisfied the Commission that
they despatched special messengers to notify the District
Commander that “satisfactory treaties had been
made with the tribes represented at Laramie and that
its route was safe.” Emigrant trains were also pushed
forward with their assurance that an ample force of
regulars had gone up the country to ensure their safety.
The sequel will appear later.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>II. General Carrington’s Romantic Expedition</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Pursuant to the plan, Brigadier-General Henry B.
Carrington, Colonel of the Eighteenth Regular Infantry,
was ordered with the second battalion of his regiment,
about to become the Twenty-seventh Regular
Infantry, to establish, organize and take command of
what was known as the Mountain District. The Mountain
District at that time had but one post in it, Fort
Reno, one hundred and sixty miles from Fort Laramie.
Carrington was directed to march to Fort Reno, move it
forty miles westward, garrison it, and then, with the balance
of his command, establish another post on the
Bozeman trail, between the Big Horn Mountains and
the Powder River, so as to command that valley much
frequented by Indians; and, lastly, to establish two other
posts, one on the Big Horn, the other on the Yellowstone,
for the further protection of the trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Carrington was a graduate of Yale College.
He had been a teacher, an engineer and scientist, a
lawyer and man of affairs, a student of military matters
as well as Adjutant-General of Ohio for several years
prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. At the beginning
of that struggle he promptly moved one battery
and several regiments of Ohio Militia into West Virginia
to take part in the Battle of Phillipi before the
State Volunteers could be mustered into the United
States service. Without his solicitation, on May 14th,
1861, he had been appointed Colonel of the Eighteenth
United States Infantry, promoted Brigadier-General
November 29th, 1863, and had rendered valuable and
important services during the war. He was a high-minded
Christian gentleman, a soldier of large experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and proven courage, an administrator of vigor
and capacity, and, as his subsequent career has shown,
a man of fine literary talents.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a> No better choice could
have been made for the expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>After many delays, due principally to difficulties in
securing transportation, a little army of seven hundred
men, accompanied by four pieces of artillery, two hundred
and twenty-six wagons, and a few ambulances containing
the wives and children of several of the officers,
set forth from old Fort Kearney, Nebraska, on the 19th
of May, 1866. About two hundred of the men were
veterans, the rest raw recruits. They were armed with
old-fashioned Springfield, muzzle-loading muskets, save
a few who had the new Spencer breech-loading carbine,
a weapon of rather short trajectory, but a great improvement
on the old army musket from the rapidity
of fire which it permitted. A portion of the command
was mounted from the discarded horses of a cavalry
regiment going east to be mustered out. They were not
trained horsemen, however, and at first were rather indifferent
mounted infantrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the soldiers were artificers and mechanics of
every description. The government had provided appliances
needed for building forts, including tools, doors,
sash, glass, nails, stoves, steel, iron, mowers, reapers,
scythes, and two steam sawmills. The officers were in
the main a fine body of men, most of whom had learned
their soldiering in the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>It seems incredible to think that women should accompany
such an expedition, but no grave anticipations
of trouble with the Indians were felt by any persons in
authority at that time. The Sioux and Cheyennes had
consented to the opening of the road, and though they
demurred to the forts, they had not absolutely refused
the treaty when the government insisted upon it.
The expedition was not conceived or planned for war.
It was supposed to be a peaceable expedition. In fact,
General Sherman, who visited Fort Kearney before the
troops began to march, personally advised the ladies to
accompany the expedition as very attractive in its object
and wholly peaceful. Had the authorities known
what was to happen, a force three times as great would
scarcely have been thought adequate for the purpose.
But even had there been a full knowledge of the dangers
incurred, the army women would have gone with
their husbands.</p>

<p class='c000'>History records no greater instances of romantic devotion
than those exhibited by the army wife. She stands
peculiar among American women to-day in that particular.
The army woman in a hostile country risked
much more than the men. Her fate when captured was
terrible beyond description—one long agony of horror
and shame until death put an end to it. I have talked
with army officers of large experience and have read
what others have said, and the universal testimony is
that no woman who was ever captured by the plains
Indians west of the Missouri was spared. It was commonly
agreed among the officers and men of regiments
accompanied by women—and fully understood by the
women as well—that in the last extremity the women
were to be shot by their own friends, rather than to be
allowed to fall into the hands of the savages; but no such
apprehension attended this march.</p>

<p class='c000'>The army woman’s knowledge of the peril in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>usual border warfare was not an imaginary one, either.
As we may read in letters and books written by army
wives, it was brought home to them directly again and
again. After every campaign poor, wretched women
of stranded and robbed emigrant trains or devastated
settlements were brought into the various camps, to
whom these army women ministered with loving care,
and from whom they heard frightful and sickening details
that froze the blood; yet the army wife herself never
faltered in her devotion, never failed in her willingness
to follow wherever her husband was sent. And, save
for the actual campaigning in the field, the army wife
was everywhere—sometimes there, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this particular expedition there were several little
children, from some of whom I have gleaned details and
happenings. One of these lads, while at Fort Kearney
before the march, became so expert with the bow and
arrow in target shooting with young Pawnee Indians
near the fort, that he challenged General Sherman to
shoot over the flagstaff. The youngster accomplished
it by lying upon his back with feet braced against the
bow, and the general squarely withdrew from the contest,
declining to follow the boy’s ingenious artifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The march was necessarily a slow one and the distance
great—some six hundred miles—so that it was
not until the twenty-eighth of June they reached Fort
Reno. There they were menaced by the Indians for
the first time and every endeavor was made to stampede
their herds. The officers and men were fast becoming
undeceived as to the character of their expedition. To
abandon Fort Reno, or to remove it, was not practicable.
Carrington ordered it re-stockaded and put in
thorough repair, garrisoned it from his command, and
with the balance, something over five hundred, advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>farther into the unknown land on the 9th of
July. On the 13th of July, 1866, he established his
camp on the banks of the Big Piney Creek, an affluent of
the Powder River, about four miles from the superb Big
Horn Range, with snow-capped Cloud Peak towering
nine thousand feet into the heavens, close at hand. A
few days later, on a little, flower-decked, grass-covered
plateau, bare of trees, which fortunately happened to be
just the size to contain the fort he proposed to erect, and
which sloped abruptly away in every direction, forming
a natural glacis, he began building the stockade.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The Outpost of Civilization</h4>

<p class='c020'>The plateau lay between two branches of the Piney.
To the eastward of the smaller branch rose a high hill
called Pilot Hill. West of it was another ridge which
they named Sullivant Hills. Southwest of Sullivant
Hills was a high ridge called Lodge Trail Ridge, the
main branch of the Piney Creek flowing between them,
so that the water supply was at the eastern or “Water
Gate” of the fort. The Bozeman trail passed westward,
under Pilot Hill in front of the fort, crossing the
Big Piney as it neared Sullivant Hills, and then, circling
around Lodge Trail Ridge for easier ascent, advanced
northward, twice crossing Peno Creek and its branches,
before that stream joined Goose Creek, a tributary to
Tongue River, one of the chief forks of the Yellowstone.
The first branch of the Peno was five miles from the fort,
and the second twelve miles farther, where the garrison
had to cut hay, but the branch nearer the fort was especially
associated with the events of December 21st, as
well as with the fight of the sixth of the same month.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spot was delightful. Adjacent to the fort were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>broad stretches of fertile, brilliantly flowered, grassy,
river and mountain creek valleys. The mountains and
hills were covered with pines. Game there was in
plenty; water was clear and abundant. Wood, while
not immediately at hand, else the place would not have
been practicable of defense without tremendous labor
in clearing it, was conveniently adjacent.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Carrington marked out the walls of the fort,
after a survey of the surrounding country as far as
Tongue River, set up his sawmills, one of them of forty
horse-power, capable of cutting logs thirty inches in
diameter, established a logging camp on Piney Island,
seven miles distant, with no intervening hills to surmount,
which made transportation easy, and began the erection
of the fort. Picket posts were established upon Pilot
and Sullivant Hills, which overlooked approaches both
from the east and the road to the mountains. Three
times Indians attempted to dislodge these pickets, once
at night; but case-shot exploding over them, and each
time causing loss of men or ponies, ended similar visitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most careful watchfulness was necessary at all
hours of the day and night. The wood trains to fetch
logs to the sawmills went out heavily guarded. There
was fighting all the time. Casualties among the men
were by no means rare. At first it was difficult to keep
men within the limits of the camp; but stragglers who
failed to return, and some who had been cut off, scalped
and left for dead, but who had crawled back to die,
convinced every one of the wisdom of the commanding
officer’s repeated orders and cautions.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>To chronicle the constant succession of petty skirmishes
would be wearisome; yet they often resulted in
torture and loss of life on the part of the soldiers, although
the Indians in most instances suffered the more
severely. One single incident may be taken as illustrative
of the life of the garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>One afternoon, early in October, the picket reported
that the wood train was attacked to the west, and shortly
after signalled the approach of a small party of soldiers
from the east. Detachments were sent from the post in
both directions. It proved to be not a reinforcement
of troops or ammunition supplies, but two ambulances
with two contract surgeons and an escort of eight men,
besides Bailey, the guide, and Lieutenant Grummond,
who had just been appointed to the Eighteenth Infantry,
and his young bride. As they approached the main
gate, accompanied by the mounted men who had been
sent out to meet them, they were halted to give passage
to an army wagon from the opposite direction. It was
escorted by a guard from a wood train, and brought in
the scalped, naked, dead body of one of their comrades,
a strange welcome, indeed, to the young wife, who, upon
leaving Laramie, had been assured of a beautiful ride
through fertile valleys without danger, and sadder yet
in its sequel two months later.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Meanwhile the work of erecting the fort was continued.
It was a rectangle, six hundred by eight hundred
feet, inclosed by a formidable stockade of heavy pine
logs standing eight feet high, with a continuous banquette,
and flaring loopholes at every fourth log. There
were enfilading blockhouses on the diagonal corners,
with portholes for the cannon, and quarters for officers
and men, with other necessary buildings. The commanding
officer’s quarters was a two-story building of
framed lumber, surmounted by a watch-tower. The
officers’ and men’s quarters were built of logs. The
warehouses, four in number, eighty feet by twenty-four,
were framed.</p>

<p class='c000'>East of the fort proper was a corral of slightly less
area, surrounded by a rough palisade of cottonwood
logs, which inclosed the wood train, hay, and miscellaneous
supplies. Everything—stockade, houses,
stables, in all their details, blacksmith shops, teamsters’
quarters, and so on—was planned by Carrington
himself.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The main fort inclosed a handsome parade ground,
in the center of which arose the tall flagstaff planned
and erected by a ship carpenter in the regiment. From
it, on the 31st of October, with great ceremony and
much rejoicing, the first garrison flag that ever floated
over the land was unfurled. The work was by no means
completed as it appears on the map, but it was inclosed,
and there were enough buildings ready to house the
actual garrison present, although the fort was planned
for a thousand men, repeatedly promised but not furnished,
while all the time both cavalry and the First Battalion
of the Eighteenth were held within the peaceful
limits of Fort Laramie’s control.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in August Captain Kinney, with two companions,
had been sent ninety miles to the northward to
establish the second post on the Big Horn, which was
called Fort C. F. Smith, and was very much smaller and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>less important than Fort Phil Kearney. The third projected
post was not established. There were not enough
men to garrison the three already in the field, much less
to build a fourth.</p>

announcing the consummation of a “satisfactory treaty of peace with all the
Indians of the Northwest,” and assuring the District Commander of the fact. The
messenger was brought in in safety, and peace lasted until his message was delivered.

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER TWO<br /> <span class='large'>The Tragedy of Fort Phil Kearney</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. How the Fighting Began</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>To summarize the first six months of fighting,
from the first of August to the close of the
year, the Indians killed one hundred and fifty-four
persons, including soldiers and citizens,
wounded twenty more, and captured nearly seven
hundred animals—cattle, mules, and horses. There
were fifty-one demonstrations in force in front of the fort,
and they attacked every train that passed over the trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the fort was still far from completion, the logging
operations were continued until mid-winter. On every
day the weather permitted, a heavily guarded train of
wood-cutters was sent down to Piney Island, or to the
heavier timber beyond, where a blockhouse protected
the choppers. This train was frequently attacked.
Eternal vigilance was the price of life. Scarcely a day
passed without the lookout on Pilot Hill signalling
Indians approaching, or the lookout on Sullivant Hills
reporting that the wood train was corralled and attacked.
On such occasions a strong detachment would be mounted
and sent out to drive away the Indians and bring in
the wood train—an operation which was invariably
successful, although sometimes attended with loss.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Hostile demonstrations were met by prompt forays
or pursuits, as circumstances permitted; and on one
occasion the general pursued a band that ran off a herd
nearly to Tongue River; but flashing mirrors betrayed
Indian attempts to gain his rear, and a return was
ordered, abandoning the stolen stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>One expedition is characteristic of many. On the
afternoon of December 6th the lookout on Sullivant
Hills signalled that the wood train was attacked, and
Captain (Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel) Fetterman, the
senior captain present, was detailed with a squad of
forty mounted men, including fifteen cavalrymen under
Lieutenants Bingham and Grummond, with Sergeant
Bowers of the infantry, a veteran of the Civil War, to
relieve the wood train and drive the Indians toward the
Peno Valley, while Carrington himself, with about a
score of mounted infantrymen, would sweep around the
north side of Lodge Trail Ridge and intercept them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians gave way before Fetterman’s advance,
hoping to lure the troops into an ambush, but at a favorable
spot they made a stand. The fighting there was
so fierce that the cavalry, which by a singular circumstance
was without its officers, gave way and retreated
headlong across the valley toward the ridge. The
mounted infantry stood its ground, and under Fetterman’s
intrepid leadership was making a brave fight
against overwhelming odds, the number of Indians
present being estimated at more than three hundred. It
would have gone hard with them, however, had not
Carrington and the first six of his detachment suddenly
swept around a small hill or divide and taken the
Indians in reverse. The general had been forced to
advance under fire, and meeting the fugitive cavalry,
ordered them to fall in behind his own detachment.
He was filled with anxiety as to the course of the fight
on the other side of the ridge.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Carrington, in his official report,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> says: “But six men turned the
point with me, one a young bugler of the Second Cavalry, who told me
that Lieutenant Bingham had gone down the road around the hill to
my right. This seemed impossible, as he belonged to Fetterman’s
command. I sounded the recall on his report, but in vain. One of
my men fell and his horse on him. The principal chief operating
during the day attempted to secure his scalp, but dismounting, with
one man to hold the horses and reserving fire, I succeeded in saving the
man and holding the position until joined by Fetterman twenty minutes
later. The cavalry that had abandoned him had not followed
me, though the distance was short; but the Indians, circling round and
yelling, nearly one hundred in number, with one saddle emptied by a
single shot fired by myself, did not venture to close in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rear detachment and Fetterman soon joined,
and by the efforts of the combined parties the Indians
were compelled to flight. It was a close call for all, but
Lieutenants Grummond and Bingham were yet unaccounted
for. Search was instantly made for these two
officers and the infantry sergeant, who had become
separated from their command while chasing some scattered
Indians. One of the officers, Lieutenant Bingham,
was dead. Lieutenant Grummond, after a hand-to-hand
fight, was closely pressed by mounted Indians
and was barely rescued. Sergeant Bowers had been
fearfully wounded and scalped, although he was still
alive, but died immediately.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> He had killed three Indians
before he had been overborne. The cavalrymen,
mostly recruits, were deeply ashamed of their defection,
which was partly due to the incaution of their officers in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>leaving them to pursue a few Indians, and they were
burning with a desire to retrieve their reputation, which
they bravely did with their lives some two weeks later.</p>

<p class='c000'>The casualties in the little command were two killed,
five wounded. A messenger was sent to the fort for an
ambulance, and the command retired in good order
without further sight of the Indians. Lieutenant Bingham
was not the first officer killed; for, five months before,
Lieutenant Daniels, riding ahead of a small party
of soldiers escorting several officers and the wife of
Lieutenant Wands from Fort Laramie, had been killed
in full view of the party. He had been horribly tortured
with a stake before he died, and the savages put
on his clothing and danced on the prairie just out of
range, in front of the party, which was too small to do
more than stand on the defensive. Lieutenant Grummond’s
wife was in the fort during the fighting on the
sixth of December, and her joy at her husband’s safe
return can be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighth of December President Andrew Johnson
congratulated Congress that treaties had been made
at Fort Laramie, and that <em>all was peace in the Northwest</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 19th of December, in this peaceful territory,
the wood train was again attacked in force. Carrington
promptly sent out a detachment under Captain
Powell with instructions to relieve the wood train, give
it his support, and return with it, but not to pursue
threatening Indians, for experience had shown that
the Indians were constantly increasing in numbers and
growing bolder with every attack. Powell efficiently
performed his task. The Indians were driven off, and,
although he was tempted to pursue them, he was too
good a soldier to disobey orders, so he led his men back
in safety to the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>By this time all warehouses were finished, and it was
estimated that one large wood train would supply logs
enough for the completion of the hospital, which alone
needed attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Impressed by Powell’s report, Carrington himself accompanied
the augmented train on the 20th, built a
bridge across to Piney Island to facilitate quick hauling,
and returned to the fort to make ready for one more
trip only. No Indians appeared in sight on that date.
Already several hundred large logs had been collected
for winter’s firewood, besides the slabs saved at the
sawmill.</p>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be denied that there was much dissatisfaction
among some of the officers at Carrington’s prudent
policy. They had the popular idea that one white man,
especially if he were a soldier, was good for a dozen
Indians; and although fifteen hundred lodges of Indians
were known to be encamped on the Powder River,
and there were probably between five and six thousand
braves in the vicinity, they were constantly suggesting
expeditions of all sorts with their scanty force. Some
of them, including Fetterman and Brown, “offered with
eighty men to ride through the whole Sioux Nation!”
While the mettle of the Sioux Nation had not yet been
fairly tried by these men, Carrington was wise enough
to perceive that such folly meant inevitable destruction,
and his consent was sternly refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total force available at the fort, including prisoners,
teamsters, citizens and employees, was about
three hundred and fifty—barely enough to hold the
fort, should the Indians make an attack upon it. Besides
which, details were constantly needed to carry
despatches, to deliver the mail, to get supplies, to succor
emigrant trains, and so on. The force was woefully inadequate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and the number of officers had been depleted
by detachment and other causes until there were but
six left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ammunition was running low. There were at one
time only forty rounds per man available. Repeated
requests and appeals, both by letter and telegram, for
reinforcements and supplies, and especially for modern
and serviceable weapons, had met with little consideration.
The officials in the far East hugged their
treaty, and refused to believe that a state of war existed;
and, if it did exist, were disposed to censure the commanding
officer for provoking it. In several instances
presents given in the treaty at Fort Laramie were found
on the persons of visiting Indians, and one captured
Indian pony was heavily loaded with original packages
of those presents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carrington had done nothing to provoke war, but had
simply carried out General Sherman’s written instructions,
sent him as late as August, to “avoid a general
war, until the army could be reorganized and increased;”
but he defended himself and command stoutly when
attacked. Some of the officers, therefore, covertly sneering
at the caution of the commander, were burning
for an opportunity to distinguish themselves on this
account, and had practically determined to make or
take one at the first chance. Fetterman and Brown,
unfortunately, were the chief of these malcontents.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Annihilation of Fetterman’s Command</h4>

<p class='c020'>On the 21st of December, the ground being free from
snow, the air clear and cold, the lookout on Sullivant
Hills signalled about eleven o’clock in the morning that
the wood train had been corralled, and was again attacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in force about a mile and a half from the fort.
A relief party of forty-nine men from the Eighteenth
Infantry, with twenty-seven troopers from the Second
Cavalry, a detachment from which, nearly all recruits
and chiefly armed with muskets as their carbines had
not reached Laramie, had joined the post some months
before, was at once ordered out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The command was first given to Captain Powell,
with Lieutenant Grummond in charge of the cavalry.
Grummond had a wife in delicate health at the post,
and he was cautioned by the officers to take care not
to be led into a trap, although his experience on the 6th,
when he had so narrowly escaped death, was, it would
seem, the best warning he could have had. This body
of men was the best armed party at the post, a few of
those designated carrying the Spencer repeating carbines.
Each company had been directed to keep forty
rounds per man on hand for immediate use in any
emergency, besides extra boxes always kept in company
quarters. The men had been exercised in firing
recently and some of the ammunition had been expended,
although they still had an abundant supply for
the purposes of the expedition. Carrington personally
inspected the men before they left, and rejected those
who were not amply provided.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation of the wood train was critical, and the
party was assembled with the greatest despatch. Just
as they were about to start, Captain Fetterman, who
had had less experience in the country and in Indian
fighting than the other officers, for he had joined the
regiment some time after the fort had been built and
expected assignment to command Fort C. F. Smith,
begged for the command of the expedition, pleading his
senior captaincy as justification for his request. Carrington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>reluctantly acceded to his plea, which indeed he
could scarcely have refused, and placed him in charge,
giving him strict and positive instructions to “relieve
the wood train, drive back the Indians, <em>but on no account
to pursue the Indians beyond Lodge Trail Ridge</em>,”
and that so soon as he had performed this duty he was
to return immediately to the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Fetterman, as has been said, had frequently
expressed his contempt for the Indians, although his
fight on December 6th had slightly modified his opinions.
Carrington, knowing his views, was particular
and specific in his orders. So necessary did he think
the caution that he repeated it to Lieutenant Grummond,
who, with the cavalry, followed the infantry out
of the gate, the infantry, having less preparation to make,
getting away first. These orders were delivered in a
loud voice and were audible to many persons—women,
officers, and men in the fort. The general went so far
as to hasten to the gate after the cavalry had left the
fort, and from the sentry platform or banquette overlooking
it, called out after them again, emphatically
directing them “on no account to pursue the Indians
across Lodge Trail Ridge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The duty devolved upon Captain Fetterman was exactly
that which Captain Powell had performed so satisfactorily
a few days before. With Captain Fetterman
went Captain Brown, with two citizens, frontiersmen
and hunters, as volunteers. These two civilians,
Wheatley and Fisher, were both armed with the new
breech-loading rapid-fire Henry rifle, with which they
were anxious to experiment on the hostiles. Wheatley
left a wife and children in the fort.</p>

<img src='images/i_059.jpg' alt='THE FETTERMAN MASSACRE Dec. 21, 1866.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Captain Frederick Brown, a veteran of the Civil War,
had just been promoted, had received orders detaching
him from the command, and was simply waiting a favorable
opportunity to leave. He was a man of the most
undaunted courage. His position as quartermaster
had kept him on the watch for Indians all the time, and
he announced on the day before the battle that he “must
have one chance at the Indians before he left.” It is
believed, however, that his impetuous counsel, due to
his good luck in many a brush with assailing parties,
which he had several times pursued almost alone,
largely precipitated the final disaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total force, therefore, including officers and citizens,
under Fetterman’s command, was eighty-one—just
the number with which he had agreed to ride through
the whole Sioux Nation. No one in the command seems
to have had the least idea that any force of Indians,
however great, could overcome it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Fetterman, instead of leading his men direct
to the wood train on the south side of Sullivant Hills,
double-quicked toward the Peno Valley on to the north
side. Perhaps he hoped that he could take the Indians
in reverse and exterminate them between his own troops
and the guard of the wood train—which all told comprised
some ninety men—when he rounded the western
end of the hills. This movement was noticed from the
fort; but, as it involved no disobedience of orders, and
as it might be considered a good tactical manœuver, no
apprehension was felt on account of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians surrounding the wood train were well
served by their scouts, and when they found that Fetterman’s
force was advancing on the other side of the
hill, they immediately withdrew from the wood train,
which presently broke corral and made its way to the
Piney, some seven miles northwest of the fort, unmolested.
As Fetterman’s troops disappeared down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>valley, a number of Indians were observed along the
Piney in front of the fort. A spherical case-shot from a
howitzer in the fort exploded in their midst, and they
vanished. The Indians were much afraid of the “gun
that shoots twice,” as they called it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time it was discovered that no doctor had gone
with the relieving party, so Acting-Assistant Surgeon
Hines, with an escort of four men, was sent out with
orders to join Fetterman. The doctor hastened away,
but returned soon after with the information that the
wood train had gone on, and that when he attempted to
cross the valley of the Peno to join Fetterman’s men he
found it full of Indians, who were swarming about
Lodge Trail Ridge, and that no sign of Fetterman was
observed. Despite his orders, he must have gone over
the ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alarm caused in the fort by this news was deepened
by the sound of firing at twelve o’clock. Six shots
in rapid succession were counted, and immediately after
heavy firing was heard from over Lodge Trail Ridge,
five miles away, which continued with such fierceness
as to indicate a pitched battle. Carrington instantly
despatched Captain Ten Eyck with the rest of the infantry,
in all about fifty-four men, directing him to join
Fetterman’s command, then return with them to the
fort. The men went forward on the run. A little later
forty additional men were sent after Ten Eyck. Carrington
at once surmised that Fetterman had disobeyed
orders, either wittingly or carried away by the ardor of
the pursuit, and was now heavily engaged with the Indians
on the far side of the ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Counting Fetterman’s detachment, the guards of the
wood train, and Ten Eyck’s detachments, the garrison
of the fort was now reduced to a very small number.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The place, with its considerable extent, might now be
attacked at any time. Carrington at once released all
prisoners from the guard-house, armed the quartermaster’s
employees, the citizens, and mustered altogether
a force of only one hundred and nineteen men
to defend the post.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Although every preparation for
a desperate defense had been made, there were not
enough men to man the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general and his remaining officers then repaired
to the observatory tower, field glasses in hand, and in
apprehension of what fearful catastrophe they scarcely
allowed themselves to imagine. The women and children,
especially those who had husbands and fathers
with the first detachment, were almost crazed with
terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently Sample, the general’s own orderly, who had
been sent with Ten Eyck, was seen galloping furiously
down the opposite hill. He had the best horse in the
command (one of the general’s), and he covered the distance
between Lodge Trail Ridge and the fort with
amazing swiftness. He dashed up to headquarters with
a message from Ten Eyck, stating that “the valley on
the other side of the ridge is filled with Indians, who are
threatening him. The firing has stopped. He sees no
sign of Captain Fetterman’s command. He wants a
howitzer sent out to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The following note was sent to Captain Ten Eyck:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forty well-armed men, with three thousand rounds,
ambulances, stores, etc., left before your courier came
in. You must unite with Fetterman. Fire slowly, and
keep men in hand. You would have saved two miles
toward the scene of action if you had taken Lodge
Trail Ridge. I order the wood train in, which will give
fifty men to spare.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No gun could be sent him. Since all the horses were
already in the field, it would have required men to haul
it. No more could be spared, and not a man with him
could cut a fuse or handle the piece anyway. The guns
were especially needed at the fort to protect women and
children.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the afternoon Ten Eyck’s party returned to
the fort with terrible tidings of appalling disaster. In
the wagons with his command were the bodies of forty-nine
of Fetterman’s men; the remaining thirty-two were
not at that time accounted for. Ten Eyck very properly
stood upon the defensive on the hill and refused to
go down into the valley in spite of the insults and shouts
of the Indians, who numbered upward of two thousand
warriors, until they finally withdrew. After waiting a
sufficient time, he marched carefully and cautiously
toward Peno Valley and to the bare lower ridge over
which the road ran.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he came across evidences of a great battle. On
the end of the ridge, nearest the fort, in a space about
six feet square, inclosed by some huge rocks, making a
sort of a rough shelter, he found the bodies of the forty-nine
men whom he had brought back. After their
ammunition had been spent, they had been stripped,
shot full of arrows, hacked to pieces, scalped, and mutilated
in a horrible manner. There were no evidences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of a very severe struggle right there. Few cartridge
shells lay on the ground. Of these men, only four besides
the two officers had been killed by bullets. The
rest had been killed by arrows, hatchets, or spears.
They had evidently been tortured to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown and Fetterman were found lying side by side,
each with a bullet wound in the left temple. Their
heads were burned and filled with powder around the
wounds. Seeing that all was lost, they had evidently
stood-face to face, and each had shot the other dead with
his revolver. They had both sworn to die rather than
be taken alive by the Indians, and in the last extremity
they had carried out their vows. Lieutenant Grummond,
who had so narrowly escaped on the 6th of December,
was not yet accounted for, but there was little
hope that he had escaped again.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. Carrington’s Stern Resolution</h4>

<p class='c020'>The night was one of wild anxiety. Nearly one-fourth
of the efficient force of the fort had been wiped
out. Mirror signals were flashed from the hills during
the day, and fires here and there in the night indicated
that the savages had not left the vicinity. The guards
were doubled, every man slept with his clothing on, his
weapons close at hand. In every barrack a noncommissioned
officer and two men kept watch throughout
the night. Carrington and the remaining officers did
not sleep at all. They fully expected the fort to be attacked.
The state of the women and children can be
imagined, although all gossip and rumor were expressly
prohibited by the commander.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='STOCKADE' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The next day was bitterly cold. The sky was overcast
and lowering, with indications of a tremendous
storm. The Indians were not accustomed to active
operations under such conditions, and there was no
sign of them about. Carrington determined to go out
to ascertain the fate of his missing men. Although all
the remaining officers assembled at his quarters advised
him not to undertake it, lest the savages, flushed with
victory, should attempt another attack, Carrington
quietly excused his officers, told the adjutant to remain
with him, and the bugle instantly disclosed his purpose
in spite of dissenting protests. He rightly judged that
the moral effect of the battle would be greatly enhanced,
in the eyes of the Indians, if the bodies were not recovered.
Besides, to set at rest all doubts it was necessary
to determine the fate of the balance of his command.
His own wife, as appears from her narrative,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> approved
his action and nerved herself to meet the possible fate
involved, while Mrs. Grummond was the chief protestant
that, as her husband was undoubtedly dead, there
should be no similar disaster invited by another expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon, with a heavily armed force of eighty
men, Carrington went in person to the scene of battle.
The following order was left with the officer of the day:
“Fire the usual sunset gun, running a white lamp to
masthead. If the Indians appear fire three guns from
the twelve-pounder at minute intervals, and, later, substitute
a red lantern for the white.” Pickets were left
on two commanding ridges, as signal observers, as the
command moved forward. The women and children
were placed in the magazine, a building well adapted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>for defense, which had been stocked with water,
crackers, etc., for an emergency, with an officer
pledged not to allow the women to be taken alive, if
the General did not return and the Indians overcame
the stockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the place where the greatest slaughter had
occurred, the men marched cautiously along the trail.
Bodies were strung along the road clear to the western
end farthest from the fort. Here they found Lieutenant
Grummond. There were evidences of a desperate
struggle about his body. Behind a little pile of rock,
making a natural fortification, were the two civilians
who had been armed with the modern Henry rifle. By
the side of one fifty shells were counted, and nearly as
many by the side of the other brave frontiersman. Behind
such cover as they could obtain nearby lay the
bodies of the oldest and most experienced soldiers in
Fetterman’s command.</p>

<p class='c000'>In front of them they found no less than sixty great
gouts of blood on the ground and grass, and a number
of dead ponies, showing where the bullets of the defenders
had reached their marks,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and in every direction
were signs of the fiercest kind of hand-to-hand
fighting. Ghastly and mutilated remains, stripped
naked, shot full of arrows—Wheatley with no less
than one hundred and five in him, scalped, lay before
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown rode to the death of both a little Indian
“calico” pony which he had given to the general’s
boys when they started from Fort Leavenworth, in
November, 1865, and the body of the horse was found
in the low ground at the west slope of the ridge, showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that the fight began there, before they could reach
high ground.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a> At ten o’clock at night, on the return,
the white lamp at masthead told its welcome story of a
garrison still intact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fetterman had disobeyed orders. Whether deliberately
or not, cannot be told. He had relieved the wood
train, and instead of returning to the post, had pursued
the Indians over the ridge into Peno Valley, then along
the trail, and into a cunningly contrived ambush. His
men had evidently fought on the road until their ammunition
gave out, and then had either been ordered to retreat
to the fort, or had retreated of their own motion—probably
the latter. All the dead cavalry horses’ heads
were turned toward the fort, by the way. Fetterman
and Brown, men of unquestioned courage, must have
been swept along with their flying men. There may
have been a little reserve on the rocks on which they
hoped to rally their disorganized, panic-stricken troops,
fleeing before a horde of yelling, blood-intoxicated warriors.
I imagine them vainly protesting, imploring,
begging their men to make a stand. I feel sure they
fought until the last. But these are only surmises;
what really happened, God alone knows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The judgment of the veteran soldiers and the frontiersmen,
who knew that to retreat was to be annihilated,
had caused a few to hold their ground and fight until
they were without ammunition; then with gun-stocks,
swords, bayonets, whatever came to hand, they battled
until they were cut down. Grummond had stayed
with them, perhaps honorably sacrificing himself in a
vain endeavor to cover the retreat of the rest of his
command. The Indian loss was very heavy, but could
not exactly be determined.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>IV. The Reward of a Brave Soldier</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Such was the melancholy fate of Fetterman and his
men. The post was isolated, the weather frightful. A
courier was at once despatched to Fort Laramie, but
such means of communication was necessarily slow, and
it was not until Christmas morning that the world was
apprised of the fatal story. In spite of the reports that
had been made and fatuously believed, that peace had
obtained in that land, it was now known that war was
everywhere prevalent. The shock of horror with
which the terrible news was received was greater even
than that attendant upon the story of the disastrous battle
of the Little Big Horn, ten years later. People had
got used to such things then; this news came like a bolt
from the blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although Carrington had conducted himself in every
way as a brave, prudent, skilful, capable soldier, although
his services merited reward, not censure, and
demanded praise, not blame, the people and the authorities
required a scapegoat. He was instantly relieved
from command by General Cooke, upon a private
telegram from Laramie, never published, before the
receipt of his own official report, and was ordered to
change his regimental headquarters to the little frontier
post at Fort Caspar, where two companies of his first
battalion, just become the new Eighteenth, were stationed,
while four companies of the same battalion,
under his lieutenant-colonel, were ordered to the relief
of Fort Phil Kearney.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The weather had become severe and the snow was
banked to the top of the stockade. The mercury was
in the bulb. Guards were changed half-hourly. Men
and women dressed in furs made from wolfskins taken
from the hundreds of wolves which infested the
outside butcher-field at night, and which were poisoned
by the men for their fur. Upon the day fixed precisely
for the march, as the new arrivals needed every roof
during a snow-storm which soon became a blizzard,
Carrington, his wife and children, his staff and their
families, including Mrs. Grummond, escorting the remains
of her husband to Tennessee, and the regimental
band, with its women and children, began that February
“change of headquarters.” They narrowly escaped
freezing to death. More than one-half of the sixty-five
in the party were frosted, and three amputations,
with one death, were the immediate result of the foolish
and cruel order.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until some time after that a mixed commission
of soldiers and civilians, which thoroughly investigated
Carrington’s conduct, having before them all
his books and records from the inception of the expedition
until its tragic close, acquitted him of all blame
of any sort, and awarded him due praise for his successful
conduct of the whole campaign. His course was
also the subject of inquiry before a purely military court,
all of them his juniors in rank, which also reported
favorably. General Sherman expressly stated that
“Colonel Carrington’s report, to his personal knowledge,
was fully sustained,” but by some unaccountable oversight
or intent, the report was suppressed and never
published, thereby doing lasting injustice to a brave
and faithful soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time the government established the sub-post
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>between Laramie and Fort Reno, so earnestly recommended
by Carrington, in October, calling it Fort
Fetterman, in honor of the unfortunate officer who fell
in battle on the 21st of December.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps it ill becomes us to censure the dead, but the
whole unfortunate affair arose from a direct disobedience
of orders on the part of Fetterman and his men.
They paid the penalty for their lapse with their lives;
and so far, at least, they made what atonement they
could. A year later opportunity was given the soldiers
at Phil Kearney to exact a dreadful revenge from
Red Cloud and his Sioux for the slaughter of their brave
comrades.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. The Improvised Corral on Piney Island</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Red cloud, who had been one of the subchiefs
of the Sioux, gained so much prestige
by the defeat and slaughter of Fetterman’s
men that he became at once the leading war
chief of the nation.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The angry braves, flushed with conquest
and eager for blood, hastened to enroll themselves
by thousands in his band.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Phil Kearney had been in a state of siege before:
it was more closely invested now than ever. Contrary
to their usual avoidance of the war-path in cold weather,
throughout the long and bitter winter there was no intermittence
to the watchfulness of the Indians. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>garrison was constantly in arms. Attacks of all sorts
were made with increasing frequency. The letters from
the soldiers which got through to the East adequately
describe their sense of the dire peril which menaced
them. “<em>This may be my last letter</em>” is a frequent
phrase. Travel on the trail was abandoned. As soon
as possible in the spring, reinforcements were hurried
up and the fort was completed, but the same state of
affairs continued right along without intermission.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the advance of summer Red Cloud gathered his
warriors and determined upon a direct attack upon the
fort itself. He was tired of skirmishing, stampeding
stock, cutting off stragglers, etc. He wanted war, real
war, and he got it! If, or when, he captured the fort,
he would advance upon the other two forts in succession
and so clear the country, once and for all, of the
detested invaders, whose soldierly qualities he seems to
have held in contempt. For the campaign he proposed
he assembled no fewer than three thousand warriors,
the flower of the Sioux Nation. Probably half of them
were armed with firearms, Winchester rifles, Spencer
repeating carbines, or old army muskets, including
those that had been captured from Fetterman’s party.
Under cover of frequent skirmishes, which prevented
much scouting on the part of the troops, Red Cloud
gathered his warriors undiscovered and unmolested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and prepared to attack about the first of August,
1867.</p>

<p class='c000'>The limits of the military reservation had been fixed
at Washington—without adequate knowledge of the
ground and in disregard of General Carrington’s request
and protests—so as to exclude the timber land of
Piney Island, from which the post had been built, and
from which the nearest and most available wood supply
must be obtained. The post had been completed, but
immense supplies of wood would be required for fuel
during the long and severe winter. This was to be cut
and delivered at the fort by a civilian outfit which had
entered upon a contract with the government for the
purpose. One of the stipulations of the contract was
that the woodmen should be guarded and protected by
the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wood-cutting began on the 31st of July, 1867, and
Captain and Brevet-Major James Powell, commanding
“C” Company, of the twenty-seventh Infantry, which
was formerly a battalion of the Eighteenth a part of
the command which had built the fort, and to which
Fetterman and his men had belonged, was detailed with
his company to guard the contractor’s party. Captain
Powell had enlisted in the army in 1848 as a private
soldier. The Civil War had given him a commission
in the regular service, and in its course he had been twice
brevetted for conspicuous gallantry, once at Chickamauga
and the second time during the Atlanta campaign,
in which he had been desperately wounded. He had had
some experience in Indian fighting before and since he
came to the post, and had distinguished himself in several
skirmishes, notably in the relief of the wood train,
a few days before Fetterman’s rashness and disobedience
precipitated the awful disaster.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Arriving at Piney Island, some seven miles from the
post, Powell found that the contractor had divided his
men into two parties. One had its headquarters on a
bare, treeless, and comparatively level plain, perhaps
one thousand yards across, which was surrounded by
low hills backed by mountains farther away. This was
an admirable place to graze the herds of mules required
to haul the wagons. As will be seen, it could also
be turned into a highly defensive position. The other
camp was in the thick of the pine wood, about a mile
away across the creek, at the foot of the mountain. This
division of labor necessitated a division of force, which
was a misfortune, but which could not be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Powell sent twelve men under a noncommissioned
officer to guard the camp in the wood, and detailed thirteen
men with another noncommissioned officer to escort
the wood trains to and from the fort. With the
remaining twenty-six men and his lieutenant, John C.
Jenness, he established headquarters on the plain in the
open.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wagons used by the wood-cutters were furnished
by the quartermaster’s department. In transporting
the cordwood, the woodmen made use of the running
gears only, the wagon bodies having been deposited in
the clearing. In order to preserve their contents and to
afford as much protection as possible to their occupants
in case of Indian attacks, the quartermaster’s department
was in the habit of lining the wagon beds with
boiler iron; and, to give their occupants an opportunity
to fight from concealment, loopholes were cut in the
sides. Almost every authority who has written of the
fight has concluded that the particular wagon beds in
question were so lined. This is a mistaken though
natural conclusion. In a letter to an old comrade who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>wrote an account of the subsequent action,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Powell
makes no mention of any iron lining, and it is certain
that the wagons were not lined, but were just the ordinary
wooden wagon beds.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There were fourteen of these wagon bodies. Powell
arranged them in the form of a wide oval. At the highest
point of the plain, which happened to be in the center,
this corral was made. The wagon beds were deep,
and afforded ample concealment for any one lying in
them. I sometimes wonder why Powell did not stand
these beds on their sides instead of their bottoms, making
a higher and stouter inclosure, the bottoms being
heavier than the sides; but it is clear that he did not.
There were plenty of tools, including a number of augers,
in the camp, and with these Powell’s men made a
number of loopholes about a foot from the ground, in
the outward sides of the wagons.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the ends of the oval, where the configuration of the
ground made it most vulnerable for attack, especially
by mounted men, two wagons complete—that is, with
bodies and running gears—were placed a short distance
from the little corral. This would break the force
of a charge, and the defenders could fire at the attacking
party underneath the bodies and through the wheels.
The spaces between the wagon bodies were filled with
logs and sacks of grain, backed by everything available
that would turn a bullet. The supplies for the soldiers
and wood party were contained in this corral.</p>

<p>The Wagon-Box Corral on Piney Island</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Instead of the old Springfield muzzle-loading musket,
with which the troops mainly had been armed up to this
time, Powell’s men were provided with the new Allen
modification of the Springfield breech-loading rifle. He
had enough rifles for his men and for all the civilian
employees, and a large number of new Colt revolvers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>with plenty of ammunition for all. The new rifle had
never been used by the troops in combat with the Indians,
and the latter were entirely ignorant of its tremendous
range and power and the wonderful rapidity
of fire which it permitted. They learned much about it
in the next day or two, however. A quantity of clothing
and blankets was issued to the troops at the fort on
the first of August, and supplies for Powell’s men were
sent down to him.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Wild Charge of the Sioux</h4>

<p class='c020'>Having matured his plans, Red Cloud determined to
begin his attack on Fort Phil Kearney by annihilating
the little detachment guarding the train.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Parties
of Indians had been observed in the vicinity for several
days, but no attack had been made since Powell’s arrival
until the second of August, when, about nine
o’clock in the morning,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a> a party of some two hundred
Indians endeavored to stampede the herd of mules.
The herders, who were all armed, stood their ground
and succeeded for the time being in beating back the
attack. While they were hotly engaged with the dismounted
force, sixty mounted Indians succeeded in
getting into the herd and running it off. At the same
time five hundred other Indians attacked the wood train
at the other camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The affair was not quite a surprise, for the approach
of the Indians had been detected and signalled from the
corral on the island a few moments before. In the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of so overwhelming a force the soldiers and civilians
at the wood train immediately retreated, abandoning the
train and the camp. Here four of the lumbermen were
killed. The retreat, however, was an orderly one,
and they kept back the Indians by a well-directed
fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the herders, seeing the stampede of the
mules, made an effort to join the party retreating from
the wood train. The Indians endeavored to intercept
them and cut them off. Powell, however, with a
portion of his force, leaving the post in command of
Lieutenant Jenness, immediately dashed across the
prairie and attacked the savages in the rear. They
turned at once, abandoning the pursuit of the herders,
and fell upon Powell, who in his turn retreated without
loss to the corral. His prompt and bold sortie had
saved the herders, for they were enabled to effect a junction
with the retreating train men and their guards and
the soldiers and civilians, and eventually gained the fort,
although not without hard fighting and some loss.
One thing that helped them to get away from the Indians
was that the savages stopped to pillage the camp
and burn it and the train. Another thing was the presence
of Powell’s command, which they could not leave
in the rear. After driving away the others and completing
the destruction of the camp, they turned their
attention to Powell’s corral.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the clothing that had been received the day
before had not been unpacked or distributed, so it was
used to strengthen the weak places in the corral. Powell’s
men lay down in the wagon beds before the loopholes;
blankets were thrown over the tops of the beds
to screen the defenders from observation and in the
hope of perhaps saving them from the ill effects of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>plunging arrow fire, and everything was got ready.
Everybody had plenty of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the men who were not good shots were told
off to do nothing but load rifles, of which there were so
many that each man had two or three beside him, one
man making use of no less than eight. Four civilians
succeeded in joining the party in the corral—a welcome
addition, indeed, bringing the total number up to thirty-two
officers and men. Among this quartet was an old
frontiersman who had spent most of his life hunting in
the Indian country, and who had been in innumerable
fights, renowned for his expertness in the use of the
rifle—a dead-shot. This was the man to whom the
eight guns were allotted. Powell, rifle in hand, stationed
himself at one end of the corral; Jenness, similarly
armed, was posted at the other, each officer watching
one of the openings covered by the complete wagons,
which were loaded with supplies so they could not be
run off easily by hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>While all these preparations were being rapidly made,
although without confusion or alarm, the surrounding
country was filling with a countless multitude of Indians.
It was impossible at the time to estimate the
number of them, although it was ascertained that more
than three thousand warriors were present and engaged.
Red Cloud himself was in command, and with him were
the great chiefs of the great tribes of the Sioux, who were
all represented—Unkpapas, Miniconjous, Oglalas,
Brulés, and Sans Arcs, besides hundreds of Cheyennes.</p>

<p class='c000'>So confident of success were they that, contrary to
their ordinary practices, they had brought with them
their women and children to assist in carrying back the
plunder. These, massed out of range on the farthest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>hills, constituted an audience for the terrible drama
about to be played in the amphitheater beneath
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We can well imagine the thoughts of that little band
of thirty-two, surrounded by a force that outnumbered
them one hundred to one. Their minds must have
gone back to that winter day, some seven months before,
when twice their number had gone down to defeat and
destruction under the attack of two-thirds of their
present foemen. It is probable that not one of them
ever expected to escape alive. The chances that they
could successfully withstand an attack from so overwhelming
a number of foes of such extraordinary bravery
were of the smallest. But not a man flinched, not a
man faltered. They looked to their weapons, settled
themselves comfortably in the wagon beds, thought of
Fetterman and their comrades, and prayed that the attack
might begin and begin at once. There were no
heroics, no speeches made. Powell quietly remarked
that they had to fight for their lives now, which was
patent to all; and he directed that no man, for any reason,
should open fire until he gave the order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some little time was spent by the Indians in making
preparations, and then a force of about five hundred Indians,
magnificently mounted on the best war ponies
and armed with rifles, carbines, or muskets, detached
themselves from the main body and started toward the
little corral lying like a black dot on the open plain.
They intended to ride over the soldiers and end the
battle with one swift blow. Slowly at first, but gradually
increasing their pace until their ponies were on a
dead run, they dashed gallantly toward the corral, while
the main body of the savages, at some distance in
their rear, prepared to take advantage of any opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>that might be made in the defenses. It was a brilliant
charge, splendidly delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the discipline of Powell’s men that not a
shot was fired as the Indians, yelling and whooping
madly, came rushing on. There was something terribly
ominous about the absolute silence of that little fortification.
The galloping men were within one hundred
yards now, now fifty. At that instant Powell
spoke to his men. The inclosure was sheeted with
flame. Out of the smoke and fire a rain of bullets was
poured upon the astonished savages. The firing was not
as usual—one volley, then another, and then silence;
but it was a steady, persistent, continued stream, which
mowed them down in scores. The advance was thrown
into confusion, checked but not halted, its impetus
being too great; and then the force divided and swept
around the corral, looking for a weak spot for a possible
entrance. At the same moment a furious fire was
poured into it by the warriors, whose position on their
horses’ backs gave them sufficient elevation to enable
them to fire over the wagon beds upon the garrison.
Then they circled about the corral in a mad gallop, seeking
some undefended point upon which to concentrate
and break through, but in vain. The little inclosure was
literally ringed in fire. Nothing could stand against it.
So close were they that one bullet sometimes pierced two
Indians.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p>CHARGE OF RED CLOUD ON THE CORRAL AT PINEY ISLAND<br /><br /><em>Drawing by R. Farrington Elwell</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Having lost terribly, and having failed to make any
impression whatever, the Indians broke and gave way.
They rushed pell-mell from the spot in frantic confusion
till they got out of range of the deadly storm that
swept the plain. All around the corral lay dead and
dying Indians, mingled with killed and wounded horses
kicking and screaming with pain, the Indians stoically
enduring all their sufferings and making no outcry. In
front of the corral, where the first force of the charge had
been spent, horses and men were stretched out as if they
had been cut down by a gigantic mowing-machine. The
defenders of the corral had suffered in their turn. Lieutenant
Jenness, brave and earnest in defense, had exposed
himself to give a necessary command and had received
a bullet in his brain. One of the private soldiers
had been killed and two severely wounded. The thirty-two
had been reduced to twenty-eight. At that rate,
since there were so few to suffer, the end appeared inevitable.
The spirit of the little band, however, remained
undaunted. Fortunately for them, the Indians had met
with so terrible a repulse that all they thought of for the
time being was to get out of range. The vicinity of the
corral was thus at once abandoned.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. Red Cloud’s Baptism of Fire</h4>

<p class='c020'>Red Cloud determined, after consultation with the
other chiefs, upon another plan which gave greater
promise of success. Seven hundred Indians, armed with
rifles or muskets and followed by a number carrying
bows and arrows, were told off to prepare themselves as
a skirmishing party. Their preparations were simple,
and consisted of denuding themselves of every vestige
of clothing, including their war shirts and war bonnets.
These men were directed to creep forward, taking advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of every depression, ravine, or other cover, until
they were within range of the corral, which they were to
overwhelm by gun and arrow fire. Supporting them,
and intended to constitute the main attack, were the
whole remaining body of the Indians, numbering upward
of two thousand warriors.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the wonderful skill of which they were masters,
the skirmishing party approached near to the corral
and began to fire upon it. Here and there, when a savage
incautiously exposed himself, he was shot by one of
the defenders; but in the main the people of the corral
kept silent under this terrible fusillade of bullets and
arrows. The tops of the wagon sides were literally
torn to pieces; the heavy blankets were filled with arrows
which, falling from a distance, did no damage.
The fire of the Indians was rapid and continuous.
The bullets crashed into the wood just over the heads of
the prostrate men, sounding like cracking thunder; yet
not one man in the wagon beds was hurt. Arguing,
perhaps from the silence in the corral, that the defenders
had been overwhelmed and that the time for the
grand attack had arrived, signal was given for the main
body of the Indians to charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were led by the nephew of Red Cloud, a superb
young chieftain, who was ambitious of succeeding in due
course to the leadership now held by his uncle. Chanting
their fierce war songs, they came, on arranged in a
great semicircle. Splendid, stalwart braves, the flower
of the nation, they were magnificently arrayed in all
the varied and highly-colored fighting panoply of the
Sioux. Great war bonnets streamed from the heads of
the chiefs, many of whom wore gorgeous war shirts; the
painted bodies of others made dashes of rich color
against the green grass of the clearing and the dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>pines of the hills and mountains behind. Most of them
carried on their left arms painted targets or shields of
buffalo hide, stout enough to turn a musket shot unless
fairly hit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under a fire of redoubled intensity from their skirmishers
they broke into a charge. Again they advanced
in the face of a terrible silence. Again at the appointed
moment the order rang out. Again the fearful discharge
swept them away in scores. Powell’s own rifle
brought down the dauntless young chief in the lead.
Others sprang to the fore when he fell and gallantly led
on their men. Undaunted, they came on and on, in spite
of a slaughter such as no living Indian had experienced
or heard of. The Indians could account for the continuous
fire only by supposing that the corral contained
a greater number of defenders than its area would indicate
it capable of receiving. So, in the hope that the
infernal fire would slacken, they pressed home the attack
until they were almost at the wagon beds. Back on the
hills Red Cloud and the veteran chiefs, with the women
and children, watched the progress of the battle with
eager intensity and marked with painful apprehension
the slaughter of their bold warriors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation was terribly critical. If they came on
a few feet farther the rifles would be useless, and the
little party of twenty-eight would have to fight hand-to-hand
without reloading. In that event the end would
be certain; but just before the Indians reached the corral,
they broke and gave way. So close had they come
that some of the troopers in their excitement actually
rose to their knees and threw the augers with which the
loopholes had been made, and other missiles, in the faces
of the Indians. Others, however, kept up the fire, which
was indeed more than mortal humanity could stand.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>What relief filled the minds of the defenders, when
they saw the great force which had come on so gallantly
reeling back over the plains in frantic desire to get to
cover, can easily be imagined. Yet such was the courage,
the desperation of these Indians, in spite of repulse
after repulse and a slaughter awful to contemplate, that
they made no less than six several and distinct charges
in three hours upon that devoted band. After the first
attack made by the men on horseback, not a single
casualty occurred among the defenders of the corral.
It was afternoon before the Sioux got enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians could not account for this sustained and
frightful fire which came from the little fort, except by
attributing it to magic. “The white man must have
made bad medicine,” they said afterwards, before they
learned the secret of the long-range, breech-loading firearm,
“to make the guns fire themselves without stopping.”
Indeed, such had been the rapidity of the fire
that many of the gun-barrels became so hot that they
were rendered useless. To this day the Indians refer
to that battle as “the bad medicine fight of the white
man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The ground around the corral was ringed with Indian
slain. They were piled up in heaps closer by, and
scattered all over the grass farther away. Nothing is
more disgraceful in the eyes of an Indian chieftain or
his men than to permit the dead bodies of those killed
in action to fall into the hands of the enemy. Red Cloud
recognizing the complete frustration of his hopes of
overwhelming Fort Phil Kearney and sweeping the invaders
out of the land at that time, now only wished to
get his dead away and retreat. In order to do so he
threw forward his skirmishers again, who once more
poured a heavy fire on the corral.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>This seemed to Powell and his exhausted men the
precursor of a final attack, which they feared would be
the end of them. Indeed Powell, in his report, says that
another attack would have been successful. From the
heat and the frightful strain of the long period of steady
fighting, the men were in a critical condition. The ammunition,
inexhaustible as it had seemed, was running
low; many of the rifles were useless. They still preserved,
however, their calm, unbroken front to the foe,
and made a slow, deliberate, careful reply to the firing
that was poured upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Red Cloud, however, had no thought of again attacking.
He only wanted to get away. Under cover
of his skirmishers he succeeded in carrying off most of
the dead, the wounded who were able to crawl getting
away themselves. A warrior, protecting himself as well
as he could with the stout buffalo-hide shield he carried,
would creep forward, attach the end of a long lariat to
the foot of a dead man, and then rapidly retreating he
would pull the body away. All the while the hills and
mountains resounded with the death chants of the old
men and women.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of these operations a shell burst in the
midst of the Indian skirmishers, and through the trees
off to the left the weary defenders saw the blue uniforms
of approaching soldiers, who a moment afterwards
debouched in the open.</p>

<p class='c000'>An astonishing sight met the eyes of the relief party.
Clouds of Indians covered the plain. The little corral
was still spitting fire and smoke into the encircling mass.
They had got there in time then. Without hesitation
the troops deployed and came forward on the run.
Their cheers were met by welcoming shouts from
Powell and his heroic comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The herders, woodsmen, and guards who had escaped
from their camp in the morning, had reached the
fort at last with the news of Powell’s imminent danger.
Major Smith, with one hundred men and a howitzer,
was at once despatched to his support. No one
dreamed that the force of Indians was so great, or perhaps
more men would have been sent, although the
number at the fort was still insufficient to permit of the
detachment of a very large party. It was now three
o’clock in the afternoon. The Indians, disheartened
and dismayed by their fearful repulse, sullenly retreated
before the advance of the charging soldiers.
There was a splendid opportunity presented to them
to wipe out Smith’s command with their overwhelming
force, for they could have attacked him in the open; but
they had had enough for that day, and the opportunity
was not embraced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Smith realized instantly that the proper thing
for him to do, in the face of such great odds, was to get
Powell’s men and return with all speed. Carrying the
bodies of the dead and wounded, the little band of defenders
joined the rescuers and returned to the fort,
leaving the barren honors of the field to the Indians,
Awho occupied it on the heels of the retiring soldiers.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. After the Battle. The Scout’s Story</h4>

<p class='c020'>Powell modestly estimated he had killed sixty-seven
Indians and wounded one hundred and twenty. Most
of his men declared the Indian loss to have been between
three and four hundred, but it was not until a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>year after the battle that the real facts were ascertained
from the Indians themselves. The loss in killed and
wounded in the engagement, on the part of the Indians,
was <em>one thousand one hundred and thirty-seven</em>. In
other words, each of the defenders had accounted for
at least thirty-six of the Indians. Amply, indeed, had
the little band avenged the death of their comrades
under Fetterman.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Colonel Dodge justly says, the account reads like
a story of Cortes.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a> At first sight it appears to be incredible.
In explanation of it, the following account,
which Colonel Dodge has preserved of a subsequent
conversation between the frontiersman to whom the
eight guns were allotted and the department commander
is of deep interest:—</p>

<p class='c022'>“How many Indians were in the attack?” asked the General.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Wall, Gin’r’ll, I can’t say fer sartin, but I think thar wur nigh onto
three thousand uv ’em.”</p>

<p class='c022'>“How many were killed and wounded?”</p>

<p class='c022'>“Wall, Gin’r’ll, I can’t say fer sartin, but I think thar wur nigh onto
a thousand uv ’em hit.”</p>

<p class='c022'>“How many did you kill?”</p>

<p class='c022'>“Wall, Gin’r’ll, I can’t say; but gi’me a dead rest, I kin hit a dollar
at fifty yards every time, and I fired with a dead rest at more’n fifty of
them varmints inside of fifty yards.”</p>

<p class='c022'>“For Heaven’s sake, how many times did you fire?” exclaimed the
astonished General.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Wall, Gin’r’ll, I can’t say, but I kept eight guns pretty well het up
for more’n three hours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On this occasion Powell received his third brevet for
heroism and distinguished conduct on the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next fall a new treaty was made with the Indians,
and the post which had been the scene alike of heartbreaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>disaster and defeat and of triumph unprecedented,
was abandoned to them. The troops were
withdrawn. The Indians at once burned it to the
ground. It was never reoccupied, and to-day is remembered
simply because of its association with the first
and, with one exception, the most notable of our Indian
defeats in the west, and with the most remarkable and
overwhelming victory that was ever won by soldiers
over their gallant red foemen on the same ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this writing (September, 1903) the once mighty
Red Cloud, now in his eighty-ninth year, is nearing his
end, and already various claimants for the now practically
empty honor of the Head-Chieftainship of the
Sioux have arisen, the two most prominent candidates
being young Red Cloud and the son of old Sitting Bull.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note</span></h4>

<p class='c020'>Since the first publication of this article I have received
the following letter, which, as it tends to confirm what
seems incredible, the terrible Indian loss, I quote in full:</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Brady</span>:</p>

<p class='c022'>Although I am much nearer three score than fifty, I still enjoy historical
romance and facts, and I have, I think, read most of your writings.
I have just read your last article and it recalls a conversation
with Red Cloud twenty years ago.</p>

<p class='c022'>He was with my dear old friend, “Adirondack Murray” and,
I think, J. Amory Knox and myself. He, Murray and Knox had been
photographed in a group. In reminiscing in regard to the Piney Island
battle, he said he went in with over three thousand braves and lost
over half. Murray asked him if he meant over fifteen hundred had
been killed then, and he said:</p>

<p class='c022'>“I lost them. They never fought again.”</p>

<p class='c022'>He knew Murray, Knox and myself wielded the pen sometimes
but that we never used private talks. I tell you the above for your
personal satisfaction. Sincerely,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mahapiya-luta, Red Cloud, was one of the most famous of the great Sioux Nation.
He was a fierce and ruthless warrior, but withal a man of his word. After the abandonment
of Fort Phil Kearney he participated in no important actions with the soldiers,
although he was elected head chief of the Sioux. In the war of 1876 his camp was
surprised by General Mackenzie before he had an opportunity to go on the war-path.
His men were disarmed, and with him were detained in the reservation. It was a
fortunate thing for the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Recently the old chief was asked to tell the story of his most thrilling adventure. It
was a tale of one man against seven, and the old man’s dim eyes grew bright and his
wrinkled face lighted up with a strange light as he told it. A well-known warrior was
jealous of Red Cloud, and, together with six of his followers, waylaid the young brave in
a lonely spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two of them were armed with rifles, the rest carried only bows and arrows, while
Red Cloud had a Winchester. At the first fire Red Cloud fell with a bullet in his thigh,
but from where he lay he contrived to kill every one of his assailants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skill and courage he displayed on that occasion won for him many admiring followers,
and as war after war with the whites broke out and he won fresh laurels his followers
increased in numbers. He joined the various secret societies, passed through the
terrible agony of the sun dance, and when, in 1866, the chiefs of the tribe signed a “peace
paper,” he stood out for and declared war. The fighting men flocked to his standard,
and when the awful massacre in which he played so conspicuous a part occurred, he was
proclaimed Chief of all the Sioux.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the prestige he lost at Piney Island he regained upon the abandonment of
the forts by the government, a most impolitic and unfortunate move.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>As I was a member of the Carrington Powder
River Expedition of 1866, I take the liberty of
sending you a short sketch of happenings
about Fort Phil Kearney. Being actively engaged
with others for some two years in making the
history of that place, I think that the account may be
of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>I left Fort Leavenworth early in the spring of 1866.
At Fort Kearney, Nebraska, we found Col. Carrington
and a part of his command, consisting of several companies
of the Eighteenth Regular Infantry. Early in
April we received some recruits for said command, and
in a short time started on what at that time was called
the Carrington Powder River Expedition. We followed
the overland trail (sometimes called the Salt Lake
trail) up the south side of the South Platte River to
Julesberg, crossed the river there, then crossed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>divide to the North Platte. From here we went to
Fort Laramie. From this point we marched west to
Mussa ranch, crossed Horse Creek, and followed the
Bozeman trail. This was a new road, and a short cut
to Montana. After following this trail fifteen miles we
struck the North Platte at Bridger’s Ferry. We
crossed here in a ferryboat—a large flat boat attached
to a large cable rope stretched across the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>We followed the North Platte River up on the right
side to a point opposite to the present site of Fort Fetterman.
At this point we left the river and struck
across the country, crossing Sand Creek and several
other small creeks, among which I now remember the
North, South, and Middle Cheyennes. They were then
merely the dry beds of what would be quite large rivers
at the time of the melting of the snow in the mountains.
At a point twenty-two miles east of the Powder River
we struck the head of the Dry Fork of the Powder
River and followed it down to the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>There on the west side we found Fort Reno, established
by General Conner in ’65 and garrisoned by a
few “galvanized soldiers.” The garrison had been
greatly reduced by desertions during the winter, the
soldiers making for Montana. “Galvanized soldiers”
was a name given to captured Rebel soldiers who enlisted
in the Union Army to do frontier duty in order to get
out of prison, and incidentally to draw pay from Uncle
Sam. We laid over here for a few days, and on the
fourth of July the Indians stampeded the stock of Al.
Leighton, the sutler. The colonel made a detail of
soldiers and citizens to go out after the Indians and recover
the stock if possible.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>It was indeed a laughable sight to see the soldiers
trying to ride mules that were not broken to ride—and
the soldiers knew about as much about riding as the
mules did. We followed the Indians to the Pumpkin
Buttes and I am free to say for myself that I was very
glad that we did not find them. Had we got in touch
with them we would have had the smallest kind of a
show to save our hair. The soldiers being mounted on
green mules, and being armed with the old Springfield
musket, and that strapped on their backs, a very few
Indians could have stampeded the mules and, in fact,
the soldiers as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>We, the citizens, had made arrangements that if the
Indians attacked us we would stick together and fight
it out the best that we could. Jim Bridger, our guide,
was with this party. He was an old timer in the mountains.
I had two years experience in the mountains
and plains prior to this time; the rest of the citizens were
good men. We returned to the fort safely but did not
recover any of the stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>A day or two later we left the fort. The first day’s
march was a very hard one, thirty-six miles to Crazy
Woman’s Fork. This creek was a very fine one, clear,
cool, and very rapid. The command was badly demoralized
by this long, hot, and dry march, no water
between that point and Fort Reno. The soldiers had
been paid off a day or two before, many had been drunk,
many more thoughtless, and did not provide for water
in spite of orders. I saw five dollars paid for a canteen
of water on this march. On our arrival at Crazy Woman’s
Fort, the commanding officer detailed a guard to
keep the soldiers from jumping into the creek and drinking
too much water.</p>

<p class='c000'>We laid over here two days, to repair wagons and
bring in the stragglers. Had the Indians been on hand,
they could have cleaned up many of the soldiers at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>time. From this creek west to the Big Horn the country
is very fine; plenty of wood, water, and grass; in fact,
a paradise. We traveled west to the forks of the Pineys.
The big and little Pineys fork near where we made our
camp, sixty-five miles west of the Powder River.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-fourth day of July we moved to the
place where we established Fort Phil Kearney. The
grasshoppers were so thick in the air that day that they
nearly obscured the sun from sight.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a> In fact, it did not
look bigger than a silver dollar. The fort was built
about as you have described it, and from the day that we
established it until I left there, in November, ’67, the
Indians were very much in evidence and plenty of fighting
nearly all that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was a teamster on this expedition, driving an ambulance
team. Made several trips to Fort Laramie and
to Fort C. F. Smith on the Big Horn. This latter Fort
was established by Carrington a short time after the
establishment of Fort Phil Kearney, and was a two-company
post.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was with the hay-making party down the Big Piney
during a part of the summer of ’66. During one of our
trips to the hay field, we were accompanied by a man
who represented <cite>Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly</cite> as
an artist. This man rode with me a part of the way. He
intended to do some sketching near there but I advised
him to stay with our outfit. However, he insisted on
stopping by the way. On our return we found him
dead, a cross cut on his breast, which indicated that they
thought him a coward who would not fight. He wore
long, black hair and his head had been completely
skinned. Probably it was the work of a band of young
Cheyenne bucks; they could cut the scalps into many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>pieces and thereby make a big show in camp. Was very
sorry for this man; he appeared to be a perfect gentleman.
His thought was, that if the Indians found him
they would not hurt him, as he intended to show them
his drawings, and also explain to them that he was not
armed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_101.jpg' alt='Plan of Magazine at Fort Phil Kearney (now Wyoming)' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Later on the Indians got so thick that we had to
abandon this hay-making business. The day that we
broke camp we had a great deal of fighting with the
Indians. I remember a soldier named Pate Smith who
borrowed a revolver from me that day. This man was
mounted. He rode too far ahead of the outfit, the Indians
cut him off. Later we heard from the Crows that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the Sioux caught him, skinned him alive. This man
was an old volunteer soldier, but what show has a man
with the old-fashioned Springfield musket? One shot
and you are done.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was at the Fort at the time of the Phil Kearney massacre
and went down with the reinforcements to that
sad scene. Our men were all down when we got there,
and cut up in the most brutal manner, such as only a
red brute would do. We buried them a little east of the
fort. They fought a good fight, but were surprised and
overpowered. As we approached the scene of action
the country was black with Indians to the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officers were clearly to blame for this slaughter;
they disobeyed the colonel’s orders, which were to guard
the wood train to the fort, and not to engage the Indians
unless attacked by them. At a point about two miles
west of the fort they left the wood train; crossed the Big
Piney Creek; got nearly to the Peno Creek, and were ambushed
by about three thousand Indians, and the entire
command killed. This band of Indians included all of
the different tribes of the Sioux, also Cheyennes, Blackfeet,
Arapahoes, and some young renegade Crow bucks.
I knew this latter statement to be true, from the fact that
one member of Company C, Second Cavalry, had stolen
a revolver from me some time before and it was with him
in this fight. It was taken from his body by the Indians.
Next spring a young Crow came to the fort. I saw the
gun under his blanket and took it away from him. If
he was in camp on the Big Horn with his people, he
could not have got this gun on this field of slaughter. I
had been wounded about six weeks prior to this fight
and had not reported for duty, but on call for volunteers
to reinforce the Fetterman party, reported for duty and
went with the command to the scene of the massacre.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>You are in error in stating that there was no communication
with the outside world during this winter. I
made one trip with my ambulance to Fort Laramie.
We had an escort of ten cavalry soldiers. We made, I
think, three trips after this without an escort, using pack
mules, the party consisting of two packers and the mail-carrier,
Van Volsey, a very fine man and a brave one,
too. Last trip up I saw Indian signs in the dry forks of
the Powder River, consisting of the remains of a camp
fire, not entirely burned out, and some Indian traps lying
around it. I refused to make another trip without an
escort. On our arrival at the fort we reported the facts,
and demanded an escort for the next trip. But owing to
the fact that the stock was in such poor condition on
account of the scarcity of food, they could not furnish
one mounted.</p>

<p class='c000'>They persuaded me to take one more trip with Van
Volsey, which I foolishly consented to do. On the first
day out I got snow blind and on our arrival at Fort
Reno requested him to get a substitute in my place.
He refused to do so and insisted that I accompany him
to Fort Laramie, but after being on the road a short
time, my eyes played out entirely. I had to return to
the fort and there secured another man to take my place.
They made the trip down all right and returning were
accompanied by two or three soldiers, who were going
to join their commands. They had got nearly to the
head of the dry fork of the Powder River when the Indians
killed the entire party. We found the bones of
the men and mules and some of the mail sacks. We
buried the men’s remains there.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the summer of ’67 life was one continual
round of fighting. We lost a great many men, but
damaged the Sioux much more than during the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>year. The soldiers had better guns, and were
far better Indian fighters. They had learned that it
was safer to keep their faces to the Indians, than, as
during the previous year, their backs. When you run
from an Indian you are his meat.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the day of the wagon-box fight, accompanied by
my partner, I left the fort before daylight. We went to
the foot-hills to get some deer. A short time after daylight
we discovered a lot of Indian smoke signals on the
hills, and decided that we had better get back to the
fort. In making our way back we followed the Little
Piney down for some distance, and found that the country
was full of Indians. We then struck out for the
wood train. The Indians had got between us and
it. We then went to the wagon-box corral, and got
there none too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your description of the corral is correct as I remember
it to be. Its location is about right, except that it
was not on an island. I never heard of Little Piney
Island, and I do not believe such an island existed there
at that time.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The wagon boxes were of the ordinary
government boxes. They were set off from the wagons,
as the wagons were in corral. The intervals between
were packed with logs, bales of blankets, clothing, sacks
of corn, etc. As to the wagon boxes being lined with
iron, you are right. They were not. Up to that time,
and during my time on the plains, I never saw wagon
boxes so lined. The wagon box that I was detailed to
fight in had no such protection, but we had gunny sacks
of corn placed on edge two deep on the inside of the box,
with a two inch auger hole at the point where the four
sacks came together. This made good protection for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the body when lying down. As stated in your article,
the tops of the wagon boxes were literally torn to pieces
with the bullets fired at us by the Indians. Without
this protection the fight would not have lasted very
long.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a surplus of ammunition and guns. I had
two Spencer carbines, and two revolvers (six-shot army
Colt’s). During the first charge I emptied the carbines
and the revolvers less two shots (reserved for myself in
case of a show down). The balance of our men must
have fired as many shots as I did. The soldier that was
in the box with me had a needle gun and a Spencer; also
one or two revolvers. And he kept them busy while he
lived. This man was an infantry soldier—do not remember
his company. He was shot through the head,
dying in about two hours after being shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Jenness had just cautioned me not to expose
my person, and to hold my fire until I was sure of
getting an Indian at each shot. He had moved a few
feet from my box when he was shot through the head. I
think he died instantly. He was a grand, good man,
and a fearless officer. I told him to keep under cover.
He stated he was compelled to expose himself in order
to look after his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>I got a slight wound in my left hand; a bullet came in
through my porthole, which I thought was close shooting
for a Sioux.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fight lasted about four hours, and was very hot
from the start. I had been in several Indian fights
prior to this time, but never saw the Indians make such a
determined effort to clean us up before. They should
have killed the entire party. They certainly had force
enough to ride over us, but our fire was so steady and
severe that they could not stand the punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Our men stood the strain well, held their fire until the
bullets would count. In fact, shooting into such a mass
of Indians as charged on us the first time, it would be
nearly impossible for many bullets to go astray. In all
my experience in fighting Indians prior to this time, I
never saw them stand punishment so well as they did at
this time; they certainly brought all their sand with
them. In charging on our little corral they rode up
very close to the wagon boxes, and here is where they
failed. Had they pushed home on the first charge, the
fight would not have lasted ten minutes after they got
over the corral.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many dead and wounded Indians lay within a few
feet of the wagon boxes. The wounded Indians did not
live long after the charge was over. They would watch
and try to get a bullet in on some of our men. We had
to kill them for self-protection. Anyway, it was evening
up the Fetterman deal. They never showed mercy to a
wounded white man, and should not expect any different
treatment. I had a canteen of water when the fight
commenced, and used most of it to cool my guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>You state that all of our loss occurred at time of the
first charge. This is an error, as the man in my box
was shot after he had been fighting nearly an hour. I
think that his name was Boyle. Up to the time that he
was shot he certainly filled the bill and did his duty,
dying with his face to the foe as a soldier should.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not try to estimate the number of the Indians, but,
as my partner said, “The woods were full of them.”
This was the largest gathering of Indians that I ever
saw, and the hardest fighting lot that I ever encountered.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the reinforcements came in sight we took on a
new lease of life, and when they dropped a shell over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Indians we knew that the fight was won. Indians will
not stand artillery fire. They call it the “wagon gun.”
The reinforcements came just in time. One hour more
of such fighting would have exhausted our men and
ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Indians carrying off all their dead and
wounded, here you are again mistaken, as many of our
men carried away with them scalps, etc., taken from
the bodies of the dead Indians near the corral.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The
Indians certainly hauled off all their dead and wounded
that they could, but did not expose themselves
very much in order to get the dead ones near the
corral.</p>

<p class='c000'>On arrival of reinforcements we immediately retreated
to the fort. Captain Powell was the right man
to command under such trying circumstances. No
better or braver man ever held a lieutenant’s commission
than Jenness. As to the Indian loss, I think you
have overestimated it. We thought that we had killed
and wounded some more than four hundred. However,
you may be right in your estimates. We had the
opportunity to clean up that number, and we certainly
did our best to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the massacre of ’66 (Dec.) we received reinforcements,
as I now remember, four companies of
infantry and two companies, L and M, of the 2d Cav.
This large additional force, stationed at a four-company
fort, and only provisioned for four companies, caused
a great deal of suffering during the winter, resulting in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>much sickness and many deaths from scurvy. Nearly
all of us were suffering from this disease. I have never
fully recovered from the effect of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Carrington was severely censured by the War
Department and many others for the Fort Phil Kearney
massacre, and, I think, unjustly. Had Col. Fetterman
and Capt. Brown and the other officers in command
obeyed his orders, the massacre would not have occurred,
not, at least, at this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fetterman and Brown were dare-devil fighters, always
anxious for a fight, and took this opportunity to
get into one. Capt. Brown, on his “calico” pony, was
a familiar figure around this fort—the boys called
him “Baldy.” The Indians were very anxious to kill
Brown; he was a thorn in their sides. While we to
some extent lay the blame of the massacre on Brown
and Fetterman, to be honest, we were nearly all partly to
blame. We were always harping at the colonel to send
a large force out and fight the Indians, but he always insisted
on a conservative course. We all thought up to
that time that one hundred good men could walk
through the entire Sioux Nation. This massacre demonstrated
that in a fight in the open the Sioux should
not have over five to one of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was well posted in regard to the Carrington Powder
River Expedition of 1866 and the history of Fort
Phil Kearney from the date of establishment to Nov.,
1867, and acquainted with all of the officers and many
of the soldiers and citizens. I probably would not
have written this little statement of actual history were
it not for the fact that in your article you stated that
you got some of the record from the only living member
of the celebrated wagon-box fight. I am still in
the flesh and will pull down the scale at two hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>pounds. In all probability there are others alive, as
we all were young men at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of the three forts established in 1865 and
1866, well written, would make interesting history, as
almost every day was full of stirring events. Quite a
number of the citizens in that country at this time were
discharged volunteer soldiers and some rebel soldiers
also. As a rule, they were hard nuts for the Indians to
crack. It was noticeable that they would not take
chances fighting citizens that they would take with the
soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>After leaving Fort Phil Kearney I went to Cheyenne
and followed the Union Pacific R. R. to the finish. Was
at Promontory Point in Utah when the Union Pacific
and Central Pacific R. Rs. connected; this was one of
the mile-stones in the history of the West, and practically
solved the Indian problem. The Indians fought
hard for this territory. It was the best hunting ground
that they had left. There were many half-breeds among
them, and they were daring and shifty fighters.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>No one will question the sweeping assertion

the Alamo. They surpassed by one
Leonidas and his Spartans; for the Greeks had a

<p class='c000'>The contagion of the successful Indian attacks on
Fort Phil Kearney had spread all over the Central West.
The Kansas Pacific was then building to Denver, and its
advance was furiously resisted by the Indians. As
early as 1866, at a council held at Fort Ellsworth,
Roman Nose, head chief of the Cheyennes, made a
speech full of insolent defiance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“This is the first time,” said the gigantic warrior,
who was six feet three and magnificently proportioned,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
“that I have ever shaken the white man’s hand in
friendship. If the railway is continued I shall be his
enemy forever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no stopping the railway. Its progress was
as irresistible as the movement of civilization itself.
The Indians went on the war-path. The Cheyennes
were led by their two principal chiefs, Black Kettle
being the second. We shall see subsequently how
Custer accounted for Black Kettle. This story deals
with the adventures of Roman Nose.</p>

<p class='c000'>As fighters these Indians are entitled to every admiration.
As marauders they merit nothing but censure.
The Indians of the early days of the nation,
when Pennsylvania and New York were border states,
and across the Alleghenies lay the frontier, were
cruel enough, as the chronicle of the times abundantly
testify; but they were angels of light compared with the
Sioux and Cheyennes, the Kiowas, Arapahoes and
Comanches, and these in turn were almost admirable
beside the Apache. The first-named group were as cruel
as they knew how to be, and they did not lack knowledge,
either. The Apaches were more ingenious and
devilish in their practices than the others. The Sioux
and the Cheyennes were brutal with the brutality of a
wild bull or a grizzly bear. To that same kind of brutality
the Apaches added the malignity of a wildcat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the subtlety of a snake. The men of the first group
would stand out and fight in the open to gain their ends,
although they did not prefer to. They were soldiers
and warriors as well as torturers. The Apache was a
lurking skulker, but, when cornered, a magnificent
fighter also.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> General Crook calls him “the tiger of
the human species.” However, from the point of detestableness
there wasn’t much to choose between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps we ought not to blame the Indians for acting
just as our ancestors of, say the Stone Age, acted in all
probability. And when you put modern weapons and
modern whisky in the hands of the Stone Age men you
need not be surprised at the consequences. The Indian
question is a terrible one any way you take it. It cannot
be denied they have been treated abominably by
the United States, and that they have good cause for
resentment; but the situation has been so peculiar that
strife has been inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>As patriots defending their country, they are not
without certain definite claims to our respect. Recognizing
the right of the aborigines to the soil, the government
has yet arbitrarily abrogated that right at pleasure.
At times the Indians have been regarded as independent
nations, with which all differences were to be settled by
treaty as between equals; and again, as a body of subjects
whose affairs could be and would be administered
willy-nilly by the United States. Such vacillations are
certain to result in trouble, especially as, needless to say,
the Indians invariably considered themselves as much
independent nations as England and France might
consider themselves, in dealing with the United States
or with one another. And the Indians naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>claimed and insisted that the territory where their fathers
had roamed for centuries belonged solely and wholly
to them. They admitted no suzerainty of any sort,
either. And they held the petty force the government
put in the field in supreme contempt until they learned
by bitter experience the illimitable power of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>To settle such a growing question in a word, offhand,
as it were, is, of course, impossible, nor does the settlement
lie within the province of these articles; but it may
be said that if the United States had definitely decided
upon one policy or the other, and had then concentrated
all its strength upon the problem; if it had realized the
character of the people with whom it was dealing, and
had made such display of its force as would have rendered
it apparent, to the keenest as well as to the most
stupid and besotted of the Indians, that resistance was
entirely futile, things might have been different. But it is
the solemn truth that never, in any of the Indian wars
west of the Missouri, has there been a force of soldiers in
the field adequate to deal with the question. The blood
of thousands of soldiers and settlers—men, women, and
children—might have been spared had this fact been
realized and acted upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cheyennes swept through western Kansas like a
devastating storm. In one month they cut off, killed,
or captured eighty-four different settlers, including
their wives and children. They swept the country bare.
Again and again the different gangs of builders were
wiped out, but the railroad went on. General Sheridan
finally took the field in person, as usual with an inadequate
force at his disposal. One of his aides-de-camp
was a young cavalry officer named George Alexander
Forsyth, commonly known to his friends as “Sandy”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Forsyth. He had entered the volunteer army in 1861
as a private of dragoons in a Chicago company. A
mere boy, he had come out a brigadier-general. In the
permanent establishment he was a major in the Ninth
Cavalry. Sheridan knew him. He was one of the two
officers who made that magnificent ride with the great
commander that saved the day at Winchester, and it was
due to his suggestion that Sheridan rode down the readjusted
lines before they made the return advance
which decided the fate of the battle. During all that
mad gallop and hard fighting young Forsyth rode with
the General. To-day he is the only survivor of that
ride.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forsyth was a fighter all through, and he wanted to
get into the field in command of some of the troops operating
directly on the Indians in the campaign under consideration.
No officer was willing to surrender his command
to Forsyth on the eve of active operations, and
there was no way, apparently, by which he could do
anything until Sheridan acceded to his importunities
by authorizing him to raise a company of scouts for the
campaign. He was directed, if he could do so, to enlist
fifty men, who, as there was no provision for the employment
of scouts or civilian auxiliaries, were of necessity
carried on the payrolls as quartermasters’ employees
for the magnificent sum of one dollar per day.
They were to provide their own horses, but were allowed
thirty cents a day for the use of them, and the horses
were to be paid for by the government if they were “expended”
during the campaign. They were equipped
with saddle, bridle, haversack, canteen, blanket, knife,
tin cup, Spencer repeating rifle, good for seven shots
without reloading, six in the magazine, one in the barrel,
and a heavy Colt’s army revolver. There were no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>tents or other similar conveniences, and four mules constituted
the baggage train. The force was intended to
be strictly mobile, and it was. Each man carried on his
person one hundred and forty rounds of ammunition for
his rifle and thirty rounds for his revolver. The four
mules carried the medical supplies and four thousand
rounds of extra ammunition. Each officer and man
took seven days’ rations. What he could not carry on
his person was loaded on the pack mules; scanty rations
they were, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as it was known that the troop was to be organized,
Forsyth was overwhelmed with applications
from men who wished to join it. He had the pick of the
frontier to select from. He chose thirty men at Fort
Harker and the remaining twenty from Fort Hayes.
Undoubtedly they were the best men in the West for
the purpose. To assist him, Lieutenant Frederick H.
Beecher, of the Third Infantry, was detailed as second in
command. Beecher was a young officer with a record.
He had displayed peculiar heroism at the great battle
of Gettysburg, where he had been so badly wounded
that he was lame for the balance of his life. He was a
nephew of the great Henry Ward Beecher and a worthy
representative of the distinguished family whose name
he bore. The surgeon of the party was Dr. John H.
Mooers, a highly-trained physician, who had come to
the West in a spirit of restless adventure. He had
settled at Hayes City and was familiar with the frontier.
The guide of the party was Sharp Grover, one of the
remarkable plainsmen of the time, regarded as the best
scout in the government service. The first-sergeant
was W. H. H. McCall, formerly brigadier-general,
United States Volunteers. McCall, in command of a
Pennsylvania regiment, had been promoted for conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>gallantry on the field, when John B. Gordon
made his magnificent dash out of Petersburg and attacked
Fort Steadman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The personnel of the troop was about equally divided
between hunters and trappers and veterans of the
Civil War, nearly all of whom had held commissions in
either the Union or Confederate Army, for the command
included men from both sides of Mason and Dixon’s
line. It was a hard-bitten, unruly group of fighters.
Forsyth was just the man for them. While he did not
attempt to enforce the discipline of the Regular Army,
he kept them regularly in hand. He took just five days
to get his men and start on the march. They left Fort
Wallace, the temporary terminus of the Kansas Pacific
Railroad, in response to a telegram from Sheridan that
the Indians were in force in the vicinity, and scouted the
country for some six days, finally striking the Indian
trail, which grew larger and better defined as they pursued
it. Although it was evident that the Indians they
were chasing greatly outnumbered them, they had come
out for a fight and wanted one, so they pressed on.
They got one, too.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Island of Death</h4>

<p class='c020'>On the evening of the fifteenth of September, hot on
the trail, now like a well-beaten road, they rode through
a depression or a ravine, which gave entrance into a valley
some two miles wide and about the same length.
Through this valley ran a little river, the Arickaree.
They encamped on the south bank of the river about
four o’clock in the afternoon. The horses and men
were weary with hard riding. Grazing was good.
They were within striking distance of the Indians now.
Forsyth believed there were too many of them to run
away from such a small body as his troop of scouts.
He was right. The Indians had retreated as far as they
intended to.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The river bed, which was bordered by wild plums,
willows and alders, ran through the middle of the valley.
The bed of the river was about one hundred and forty
yards wide. In the middle of it was an island about
twenty yards wide and sixty yards long. The gravelly
upper end of the island, which rose about two feet above
the water level, was covered with a thick growth of
stunted bushes, principally alders and willows; at the
lower end, which sloped to the water’s edge, there rose
a solitary cottonwood tree. There had been little rain
for some time, and this river bed for the greater part
of its width was dry and hard.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a> For a space of
four or five yards on either side of the island there was
water, not over a foot deep, languidly washing the gravelled
shores. When the river bed was full the island
probably was overflowed. Such islands form from time
to time, and are washed away as quickly as they develop.
The banks of the river bed on either side commanded
the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simple preparations for the camp of that body of
men were soon made. As night fell they rolled themselves
in their blankets, with the exception of the sentries,
and went to sleep with the careless indifference of
veterans under such circumstances.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>BEECHER’S ISLAND FIELD<br /><br />The battle took place just about where the cattle are standing in the river. The shifting current has obliterated the Island.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Forsyth, however, as became a captain, was not so
careless or so reckless as his men. They were alone in
the heart of the Indian country, in close proximity to an
overwhelming force, and liable to attack at any moment.
He knew that their movements had been observed by the
Indians during the past few days. Therefore the
young commander was on the alert throughout the night,
visiting the outposts from time to time to see that careful
watch was kept.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as the first streaks of dawn began to “lace the
severing clouds,” he happened to be standing by the
sentry farthest from the camp. Silhouetted against the
sky-line they saw the feathered head of an Indian. For
Forsyth to fire at him was the work of an instant. At
the same time a party which had crept nearer to the
picket line unobserved dashed boldly at the horses, and
resorting to the usual devices with bells, horns, hideous
yells, and waving buffalo robes, attempted to stampede
the herd.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men like those scouts under such circumstances slept
with their boots on. The first shot called them into
instant action. They ran instinctively to the picket
line. A sharp fire, and the Indians were driven off at
once. Only the pack mules got away. No pursuit was
attempted, of course. Orders were given for the men
to saddle their horses and stand by them. In a few
moments the command was drawn up in line, each man
standing by his horse’s head, bridle reins through his
left arm, his rifle grasped in his right hand—ready!
Scarcely had the company been thus assembled when
Grover caught Forsyth’s arm and pointed down the
valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God!” he cried, “look at the Injuns!”</p>

<p class='c000'>In front of them, on the right of them, in the rear of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>them, the hills and valleys on both sides of the river
seemed suddenly to be alive with Indians. It was as
quick a transformation from a scene of peaceful quiet
to a valley filled with an armed force as the whistle of
Roderick Dhu had effected in the Scottish glen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The way to the left, by which they had entered the valley,
was still open. Forsyth could have made a running
fight for it and dashed for the gorge through which he
had entered the valley. There were, apparently, no
Indians barring the way in that direction. But Forsyth
realized instantly that for him to retreat would
mean the destruction of his command, that the Indians
had in all probability purposely left him that way
of escape, and if he tried it he would be ambushed in the
defile and slain. That was just what they wanted him
to do, it was evident. That was why he did not attempt it.
He was cornered, but he was not beaten, and he did not
think he could be. Besides, he had come for that fight,
and that fight he was bound to have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever he was to do he must do quickly. There
was no place to which he could go save the island.
That was not much of a place at best, but it was the one
strategic point presented by the situation. Pouring a
heavy fire into the Indians, Forsyth directed his men to
take possession of the island under cover of the smoke.
In the movement everything had to be abandoned, including
the medical stores and rations, but the precious
ammunition—that must be secured at all hazards.
Protected by a squad of expert riflemen on the river
bank, who presently joined them, the scouts reached
the island in safety, tied their horses to the bushes
around the edge of it, and in the intervals of fighting
set to work digging rifle-pits covering an ellipse twenty
by forty yards, one pit for each man, with which to defend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the upper and higher part of the island They
had nothing to dig with except tin cups, tin plates, and
their bowie knives, but they dug like men. There was
no lingering or hesitation about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief of the Indian force, which was made up
of Northern Cheyennes, Oglala and Brulé Sioux,
with a few Arapahoes and a number of Dog Soldiers,
was the famous Roman Nose, an enemy to be feared
indeed. He was filled with disgust and indignation at
the failure of his men to occupy the island, the strategic
importance of which he at once detected. It is believed
that orders to seize the island had been given, but for
some reason they had not been obeyed; and to this oversight
or failure was due the ultimate safety of Forsyth’s
men. It was not safe to neglect the smallest point in
fighting with a soldier like Forsyth.</p>

<p class='c000'>With more military skill than they had ever displayed
before, the Indians deliberately made preparations for
battle. The force at the disposal of Roman Nose was
something less than one thousand warriors. They were
accompanied by their squaws and children. The latter
took position on the bluffs on the east bank of the river,
just out of range, where they could see the whole affair.
Like the ladies of the ancient tournaments, they were
eager to witness the fighting and welcome the victors,
who, for they never doubted the outcome, were certain
to be their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roman Nose next lined the banks of the river on both
sides with dismounted riflemen, skilfully using such
concealment as the ground afforded. The banks were
slightly higher than the island, and the Indians had
a plunging fire upon the little party. The riflemen on
the banks opened fire at once. A storm of bullets was
poured upon the devoted band on the island. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>scouts, husbanding their ammunition, slowly and deliberately
replied, endeavoring, with signal success, to
make every shot tell. As one man said, they reckoned
“every ca’tridge was wuth at least one Injun.” The
horses of the troop, having no protection, received the
brunt of the first fire. They fell rapidly, and their carcasses
rising in front of the rifle-pits afforded added protection
to the soldiers. There must have been a renegade
white man among the savages, for in a lull of the
firing the men on the island heard a voice announce in
perfect English, “There goes the last of their horses,
anyway.” Besides this, from time to time, the notes of
an artillery bugle were heard from the shore. The casualties
had not been serious while the horses stood, but
as soon as they were all down the men began to suffer.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>During this time Forsyth had been walking about in
the little circle of defenders encouraging his men. He
was met on all sides with insistent demands that he lie
down and take cover, and, the firing becoming hotter, he
at last complied. The rifle-pit which Surgeon Mooers
had made was a little wider than that of the other men,
and as it was a good place from which to direct the
fighting, at the doctor’s suggestion some of the scouts
scooped it out to make it a little larger, and Forsyth lay
down by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire of the Indians had been increasing. Several
scouts were killed, more mortally wounded, and some
slightly wounded. Doctor Mooers was hit in the forehead
and mortally wounded. He lingered for three days,
saying but one intelligent word during the whole period.
Although he was blind and speechless, his motions sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>indicated that he knew where he was. He would
frequently reach out his foot and touch Forsyth. A
bullet struck Forsyth in the right thigh, and glancing
upwards bedded itself in the flesh, causing excruciating
pain. He suffered exquisite anguish, but his present
sufferings were just beginning, for a second bullet struck
him in the leg, between the knee and ankle, and smashed
the bone, and a third glanced across his forehead,
slightly fracturing his skull and giving him a splitting
headache, although he had no time to attend to it then.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The Charge of the Five Hundred</h4>

<p class='c020'>During all this time Roman Nose and his horsemen
had withdrawn around the bend up the river, which
screened them from the island. At this juncture they
appeared in full force, trotting up the bed of the river in
open order in eight ranks of about sixty front. Ahead
of them, on a magnificent chestnut horse, trotted Roman
Nose. The warriors were hideously painted, and all
were naked except for moccasins and cartridge belts.
Eagle feathers were stuck in their long hair, and many
of them wore gorgeous feather war bonnets. They sat
their horses without saddles or stirrups, some of them
having lariats twisted around the horses’ bellies like a
surcingle. Roman Nose wore a magnificent war bonnet
of feathers streaming behind him in the wind and surmounted
by two buffalo-horns; around his waist he had
tied an officer’s brilliant scarlet silk sash, which had been
presented to him at the Fort Ellsworth conference.
The sunlight illumined the bronze body of the savage
Hercules, exhibiting the magnificent proportions of the
man. Those who followed him were in every way worthy
of their leader.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>As the Indian cavalry appeared around the bend to
the music of that bugle, the fire upon the island from the
banks redoubled in intensity. Forsyth instantly divined
that Roman Nose was about to attempt to ride
him down. He also realized that, so soon as the horses
were upon him, the rifle fire from the bank would of
necessity be stopped. His order to his men was to
cease firing, therefore; to load the magazines of their
rifles, charge their revolvers, and wait until he gave the
order to fire. The rifles of the dead and those of the
party too severely wounded to use them were distributed
among those scouts yet unharmed. Some of the wounded
insisted upon fighting. Forsyth propped himself up
in his rifle-pit, his back and shoulders resting against
the pile of earth, his rifle and revolver in hand. He
could see his own men, and also the Indians coming up
the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently, shouting their war songs, at a wild pealed
whoop from their chief, the Indian horsemen broke into
a gallop, Roman Nose leading the advance, shaking
his heavy Spencer rifle—captured, possibly, from Fetterman’s
men—in the air as if it had been a reed.
There was a last burst of rifle fire from the banks, and
the rattle of musketry was displaced by the war songs
of the Indians and the yells of the squaws and children
on the slopes of the hills. As the smoke drifted away
on that sunny September morning, they saw the Indians
almost upon them. In spite of his terrible wounds the
heroic Forsyth was thoroughly in command. Waiting
until the tactical moment when the Indians were but
fifty yards away and coming at a terrific speed, he
raised himself on his hands to a sitting position and
cried, “Now!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The men rose to their knees, brought their guns to
their shoulders, and poured a volley right into the face
of the furious advance. An instant later, with another
cartridge in the barrel they delivered a second volley.
Horses and men went down in every direction; but, like
the magnificent warriors they were, the Indians closed up
and came sweeping down. The third volley was poured
into them. Still they came. The war songs had ceased
by this time, but in undaunted spirit, still pealing his war
cry above the crashing of the bullets, at the head of his
band, with his magnificent determination unshaken,
Roman Nose led such a ride as no Indian ever attempted
before or since. And still those quiet, cool men continued
to pump bullets into the horde. At the fourth
volley the medicine man on the left of the line and the
second in command went down. The Indians hesitated
at this reverse, but swinging his rifle high in the air
in battle frenzy, the great war chief rallied them, and
they once more advanced. The fifth volley staggered
them still more. Great gaps were opened in their ranks.
Horses and men fell dead, but the impetus was so great,
and the courage and example of their leader so splendid,
that the survivors came on unchecked. The sixth volley
did the work. Just as he was about to leap on the
island, Roman Nose and his horse were both shot to
pieces. The force of the charge, however, was so great
that the line was not yet entirely broken. The horsemen
were within a few feet of the scouts, when the
seventh volley was poured into their very faces. As a
gigantic wave meets a sharply jutting rock and is parted,
falling harmlessly on either side of it, so was that charge
divided, the Indians swinging themselves to the sides
of their horses as they swept down the length of the
island.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scouts sprang to their feet at this juncture, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>almost at contact range jammed their revolver shots at
the disorganized masses. The Indians fled precipitately
to the banks on either side, and the yelling of the
war chants of the squaws and children changed into
wails of anguish and despair, as they marked the death
of Roman Nose and the horrible slaughter of his followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a most magnificent charge, and one which for
splendid daring and reckless heroism would have done
credit to the best troops of any nation in the world.
And magnificently had it been met. Powell’s defense
of the corral on Piney Island was a remarkable achievement,
but it was not to be compared to the fighting of
these scouts on the little open, unprotected heap of sand
and gravel in the Arickaree.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the Indian horsemen withdrew, baffled
and furious, a rifle fire opened once more from the
banks. Lieutenant Beecher, who had heroically performed
his part in the defense, crawled over to Forsyth
and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have my death wound, General. I am shot in the
side and dying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said the words quietly and simply, as if his communication
was utterly commonplace, then stretched
himself out by his wounded commander, lying, like
Steerforth, with his face upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, Beecher, no,” said Forsyth, out of his own anguish;
“it can not be as bad as that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the young officer, “good-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing to be done for him. Forsyth
heard him whisper a word or two of his mother, and then
delirium supervened. By evening he was dead. In
memory of the brave young officer, they called the place
where he had died Beecher’s Island.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>At two o’clock in the afternoon a second charge of
horse was assayed in much the same way as the first
had been delivered; but there was no longer a great war
chief in command, and this time the Indians broke at
one hundred yards from the island. At six o’clock at
night they made a final attempt. The whole party,
horse and foot, in a solid mass rushed from all sides
upon the island. They came forward, yelling and firing,
but they were met with so severe a fire from the rifle-pits
that, although some of them actually reached the
foot of the island, they could not maintain their position,
and were driven back with frightful loss. The
men on the island deliberately picked off Indian
after Indian as they came, so that the dry river bed
ran with blood. The place was a very hell to the
Indians. They withdrew at last, baffled, crushed,
beaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>With nightfall the men on the island could take account
of the situation. Two officers and four men were
dead or dying, one officer and eight men were so severely
wounded that their condition was critical. Eight
men were less severely wounded, making twenty-three
casualties out of fifty-one officers and men.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a> There
were no rations, but thank God there was an abundance
of water. They could get it easily by digging in the
sandy surface of the island. They could subsist, if
necessary, on strips of meat cut from the bodies of the
horses. The most serious lack was of medical attention.
The doctor lying unconscious, the wounded were
forced to get along with the unskilled care of their comrades,
and with water, and rags torn from clothing for
dressings. Little could be done for them. The day
had been frightfully hot, but, fortunately, a heavy rain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>fell in the night, which somewhat refreshed them. The
rifle-pits were deepened and made continuous by piling
saddles and equipments, and by further digging in the
interspaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the curious Indian superstitions, which has
often served the white man against whom he has fought
to good purpose, is that when a man is killed in the dark
he must pass all eternity in darkness. Consequently,
he rarely ever attacks at night. Forsyth’s party felt
reasonably secure from any further attack, therefore,
notwithstanding which they kept watch.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. The Siege of the Island</h4>

<p class='c020'>As soon as darkness settled down volunteers were
called for to carry the news of their predicament to
Fort Wallace, one hundred miles away. Every man
able to travel offered himself for the perilous journey.
Forsyth selected Trudeau and Stillwell. Trudeau was
a veteran hunter, Stillwell a youngster only nineteen
years of age, although he already gave promise of the
fame as a scout which he afterwards acquired. To
them he gave the only map he possessed. They were
to ask the commander of Fort Wallace to come to his
assistance. As soon as the two brave scouts had left,
every one realized that a long wait would be entailed
upon the little band, if, indeed, it was not overwhelmed
meanwhile, before any relieving force could reach the
island. And there were grave doubts as to whether, in
any event, Trudeau and Stillwell could get through the
Indians. It was not a pleasant night they spent, therefore,
although they were busy strengthening the defenses,
and nobody got any sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the next morning the Indians again made their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>appearance. They had hoped that Forsyth and his men
would have endeavored to retreat during the night, in
which event they would have followed the trail and
speedily annihilated the whole command. But Forsyth
was too good a soldier to leave the position he had
chosen. During the fighting of the day before he had
asked Grover his opinion as to whether the Indians
could deliver any more formidable attack than the one
which had resulted in the death of Roman Nose, and
Grover, who had had large experience, assured him that
they had done the best they could, and indeed better
than he or any other scout had ever seen or heard of in
any Indian warfare. Forsyth was satisfied, therefore,
that they could maintain the position, at least until they
starved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians were quickly apprised, by a volley which
killed at least one man, that the defenders of the island
were still there. The place was closely invested, and
although the Indians made several attempts to approach
it under a white flag, they were forced back by the accurate
fire of the scouts, and compelled to keep their
distance. It was very hot. The sufferings of the
wounded were something frightful. The Indians were
having troubles of their own, too. All night and all day
the defenders could hear the beating of the tom-toms
or drums and the mournful death songs and wails of the
women over the bodies of the slain, all but three of whom
had been removed during the night.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a> These three were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>lying so near the rifle-pits that the Indians did not dare
to approach near enough to get them. The three dead
men had actually gained the shore of the island before
they had been killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The command on the island had plenty to eat, such
as it was. There was horse and mule meat in abundance.
They ate it raw, when they got hungry enough.
Water was plentiful. All they had to do was to dig the
rifle-pits a little deeper, and it came forth in great quantities.
It was weary waiting, but there was nothing else
to do. They dared not relax their vigilance a moment.
The next night, the second, Forsyth despatched two
more scouts, fearing the first two might not have got
through, thus seeking to “make assurance double sure.”
This pair was not so successful as the first. They came
back about three o’clock in the morning, having been
unable to pass the Indians, for every outlet was heavily
guarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third day the Indian women and children were
observed withdrawing from the vicinity. This cheered
the men greatly, as it was a sign that the Indians intended
to abandon the siege. The warriors still remained,
however, and any incautious exposure was a signal for
a volley. That night two more men were despatched
with an urgent appeal, and these two succeeded in getting
through. They bore this message:</p>

<div class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Sept. 19, 1868.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To <span class='sc'>Colonel Bankhead</span>, or Commanding Officer,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fort Wallace:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I sent you two messengers on the night of the 17th
inst., informing you of my critical condition. I tried to
send two more last night, but they did not succeed in
passing the Indian pickets, and returned. If the others
have not arrived, then hasten at once to my assistance.
I have eight badly wounded and ten slightly wounded
men to take in.... Lieutenant Beecher is dead, and
Acting Assistant Surgeon Mooers probably cannot live
the night out. He was hit in the head Thursday,
and has spoken but one rational word since. I am
wounded in two places—in the right thigh, and my
left leg is broken below the knee....</p>

<p class='c022'>I am on a little island, and have still plenty of ammunition
left. We are living on mule and horse meat,
and are entirely out of rations. If it was not for so
many wounded, I would come in, and take the chances
of whipping them if attacked. They are evidently sick
of their bargain.... I can hold out for six days
longer if absolutely necessary, but please lose no time.</p>

<p class='c022'>P.S.—My surgeon having been mortally wounded,
none of my wounded have had their wounds dressed yet,
so please bring out a surgeon with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth day passed like the preceding, the squaws
all gone, the Indians still watchful. The wound in
Forsyth’s leg had become excruciatingly painful, and
he begged some of the men to cut out the bullet. But
they discovered that it had lodged near the femoral
artery, and fearful lest they should cut the artery and the
young commander should bleed to death, they positively
refused. In desperation, Forsyth cut it out himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>He had his razor in his saddle bags and, while two men
pressed the flesh back, he performed the operation successfully,
to his immediate relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifth day the mule and horse meat became putrid
and therefore unfit to eat. An unlucky coyote wandered
over to the island, however, and one of the men
was fortunate enough to shoot him. Small though he
was, he was a welcome addition to their larder, for he
was fresh. There was but little skirmishing on the fifth
day, and the place appeared to be deserted. Forsyth
had half a dozen of his men raise him on a blanket above
the level of the rifle beds so that he might survey the
scene himself. Not all the Indians were gone, for a sudden
fusillade burst out from the bank. One of the men
let go the corner of the blanket which he held while the
others were easing Forsyth down, and he fell upon his
wounded leg with so much force that the bone protruded
through the flesh. He records that he used some severe
language to that scout.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the sixth day Forsyth assembled his men about
him, and told them that those who were well enough to
leave the island would better do so and make for Fort
Wallace; that it was more than possible that none of the
messengers had succeeded in getting through; that the
men had stood by him heroically, and that they would
all starve to death where they were unless relief should
come; and that they were entitled to a chance for their
lives. He believed the Indians, who had at last disappeared,
had received such a severe lesson that they
would not attack again, and that if the men were circumspect
they could get through to Fort Wallace in
safety. The wounded, including himself, must be left
to take care of themselves and take the chances of escape
from the island.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The proposition was received in surprised silence for
a few moments, and then there was a simultaneous shout
of refusal from every man: “Never! We’ll stand by
you.” McCall, the first sergeant and Forsyth’s right-hand
man since Beecher had been killed, shouted out
emphatically: “We’ve fought together, and, by Heaven,
if need be, we’ll die together.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They could not carry the wounded; they would not
abandon them. Remember these men were not regular
soldiers. They were simply a company of scouts,
more or less loosely bound together, but, as McCall had
pointed out, they were tied to one another by something
stronger than discipline. Not a man left the island,
although it would have been easy for the unwounded to
do so, and possibly they might have escaped in safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>For two more days they stood it out. There was no
fighting during this time, but the presence of an Indian
vedette indicated that they were under observation.
They gathered some wild plums and made some jelly for
the wounded; but no game came their way, and there was
little for them to do but draw in their belts a little tighter
and go hungry, or, better, go hungrier. On the morning
of the ninth day, one of the men on watch suddenly
sprang to his feet, shouting:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are moving men on the hills.” Everybody
who could stand was up in an instant, and Grover, the
keen-eyed scout, shouted triumphantly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the God above us, there’s an ambulance!” They
were rescued at last.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The serial publication of this article called
forth another version of this affair, differing from it in
some non-essential features, which was written by Mr.
Herbert Myrick, and published serially. Mr. Myrick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>accounts for the “mysterious voice” which the scouts
heard saying in English, “There goes the last of
their horses anyway,” by disclosing the interesting fact
that there were two renegade white men among the
Indians. One of them was called “Nibsi” or “Black
Jack,” a notorious desperado, who was afterwards
hung for murder. The other was Jack Clybor, once
a trooper of the Seventh Cavalry. Having been shot
and left for dead in an engagement, the Indians captured
him, nursed him back to life, adopted him, and
named him “Comanche.” He was a singular compound
of good and evil, and became as notorious for his
good deeds as for his bad acts. Mr. Myrick has been
collecting a mass of unknown and unpublished Western
material for many years, which when published will
undoubtedly clear up many mysteries, throw light upon
many disputed questions, and prove of the deepest interest
as well.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>General Fry, in his valuable book, “Army Sacrifices,” now unfortunately out of
print and scarce, thus graphically describes him: “A veritable man of war, the shock
of battle and scenes of carnage and cruelty were as of the breath of his nostrils; about
thirty years of age, standing six feet three inches high, he towered giant-like above his
companions. A grand head with strongly marked features, lighted by a pair of fierce
black eyes; a large mouth with thin lips, through which gleamed rows of strong, white
teeth; a Roman nose with dilated nostrils like those of a thoroughbred horse, first attracted
attention, while a broad chest, with symmetrical limbs on which the muscles
under the bronze of his skin stood out like twisted wire, were some of the points of this
splendid animal. Clad in buckskin leggings and moccasins elaborately embroidered
with beads and feathers, with a single eagle feather in his scalp-lock, and with that rarest
of robes, a white buffalo, beautifully tanned and soft as cashmere, thrown over his naked
shoulders, he stood forth, the war chief of the Cheyennes.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reason why an Indian will sacrifice everything to remove the body of one of his
tribe or kin who has been killed, is to prevent the taking of his scalp. The religious belief
of the Indians is that a man who is scalped cannot enter the happy hunting grounds,
but is doomed to wander in outer darkness forever. For that reason he always scalps his
enemy, so that when he himself reaches the happy hunting grounds he will not be bothered
by a lot of enemies whom he has met and overcome during his lifetime. Naturally,
it was a point of honor for him to get the bodies of his friends away, so that they might
not be debarred from the Indian Heaven in the hereafter. Sometimes, however, the Indian
did not scalp the body of a particularly brave man, for this reason: It is his belief
that if he kills a man in battle and does not scalp him, that man will be his slave or servant
in the happy hunting grounds, and although the victim still possesses capacities for
mischief, the Indian sometimes risks all in the future glory that will come to him from
holding in slavery a brave man, or a noted warrior, as a spiritual witness to his prowess.
It is stated that the Indians never scalp the bodies of negroes and suicides. “Buffalo soldier
heap bad medicine,” is their universal testimony when asked why they do not
scalp negro troopers whom they have killed or captured. Perhaps they cannot scalp a
woolly, kinky-haired black soldier, and that is the reason it is “bad medicine.” Suicide
is “bad medicine,” too, for some unexplained reason.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER SIX<br /> <span class='large'>The Journey of the Scouts and the Rescue of Forsyth</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. The Adventures of the Scouts</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Trudeau and Stillwell, the first pair of scouts
despatched by Forsyth with the story of his
desperate situation on Beecher’s Island, left
their commander about midnight on the evening
of the first day of the attack. The Indians had
withdrawn from the immediate vicinity of the river
and were resting quietly in the camps on either side,
although there were a number of warriors watching
the island. The men bade a hasty good-by to their
comrades, received their captain’s final instructions,
and with beating hearts stole away on their desperate
errand.</p>

<p class='c000'>They neglected no precaution that experience could
dictate. They even took off their boots, tied them
together by the straps, slung them around their necks,
and walked backward down the bed of the river in their
stocking feet, so that, if the Indians by any chance
stumbled upon their trail the next morning, it would
appear to have been made by moccasined feet and perhaps
escape attention, especially as the tracks would
point toward the island instead of away from it. Further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to disguise themselves, they wrapped themselves in
blankets, which they endeavored to wear as the Indians
did.</p>

<p class='c000'>They proceeded with the most fearsome caution.
Such was the circumspection with which they moved
and the care necessary because of the watchfulness of
the foe, who might be heard from time to time moving
about on the banks, that by daylight they had progressed
but two miles. During most of the time after
leaving the river bed they had crawled on their hands
and knees. Before sunrise they were forced to seek
such concealment as they could find in a washout, a dry
ravine, within sight and sound of the Indian camps.
Providence certainly protected them, for if any of the
Indians had happened to wander in their direction there
was nothing to prevent their discovery; and if the savages
had stumbled upon their hiding-place it would
have been all up with them. Death by torture would
have been inevitable if they were taken alive, and the
only way to prevent that would be suicide. They had
determined upon that. They had pledged each other to
fight until the last cartridge, and to save that for themselves.
They had nothing to eat and nothing to drink.
The sun beat down upon them fiercely all the long day.
After their experience of the one before, it was a day
calculated to break down the strongest of men. They
bore up under the strain, however, as best they could,
and when darkness came they started out once more.</p>

<p>“SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THEIR ARRIVAL A RATTLESNAKE MADE HIS APPEARANCE”<br /><br /><em>Drawing by Will Crawford</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This night there was no necessity for so much caution
and they made better progress, although they saw and
successfully avoided several parties of Indians. When
the day broke they were forced to conceal themselves
again. The country was covered with wandering war
parties, and it was not yet safe to travel by daylight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>This day they hid themselves under the high banks of
a river. Again they were fortunate in remaining unobserved,
although several times bands of warriors passed
near them. They traveled all the third night, making
great progress. Morning found them on an open plain
with no place to hide in but a buffalo wallow—a dry
alkali mud-hole which had been much frequented in the
wet season by buffalo—which afforded scanty cover
at best.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this day a large party of scouting Indians
halted within one hundred feet of the wallow. Simultaneously
with their arrival a wandering rattlesnake
made his appearance in front of the two scouts, who were
hugging the earth and expecting every minute to be
discovered. The rattlesnake in his way was as deadly
as the Indians. The scouts could have killed him
easily had it not been for the proximity of the Cheyennes.
To make the slightest movement would call attention
to their hiding-place. Indeed, the sinister rattle of the
venomous snake before he struck would probably attract
the notice of the alert Indians. Between the
savage reptile and the savage men the scouts were in
a frightful predicament, which young Stillwell, a lad
of amazing resourcefulness, instantly and effectually
solved. He was chewing tobacco at the time, and as
the snake drew near him and made ready to strike, he
completely routed him by spitting tobacco juice in his
mouth and eyes and all over his head. The rattlesnake
fled; he could not stand such a dose. The Indians
presently moved on, having noticed nothing, and so ended
perhaps the most terrible half hour the two men had
ever experienced.</p>

<p class='c000'>They started early on the evening of the fourth night,
and this time made remarkable progress. Toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>morning, however, Trudeau all but broke down. The
brunt of the whole adventure thereupon fell on Stillwell.
He encouraged his older companion, helped him
along as best he could, and finally, late at night, they
reached Fort Wallace and told their tale. Instantly all
was excitement in the post. Captain and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
Louis H. Carpenter, with seventy men
of Troop H, of the Tenth Cavalry (a negro regiment),
with Lieutenants Banzhaf and Orleman, Doctor Fitzgerald
and seventeen scouts, with thirteen wagons and
an ambulance, had been sent out from the post the day
before with orders to make a camp on the Denver road,
about sixty miles from the fort. From there he was to
scout in every direction, keep off the Indians, and protect
trains.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eleven o’clock at night a courier was despatched
to Carpenter with the following order:</p>

<p class='c000'>One hour afterward Bankhead himself, with one
hundred men and two howitzers and the surgeon,
started for the relief of Forsyth. With Bankhead went
the undaunted Stillwell as guide. Trudeau had suffered
so much during the perilous journey that he was
unable to accompany the relief party, and he soon afterward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>died from the hardships and excitement of the
horrible days he had passed through.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Rescue of Forsyth</h4>

<p class='c020'>Carpenter had bivouacked on the evening of the 22d
of September at Cheyenne Wells, about thirty-five
miles from Fort Wallace. He had broken camp early
in the morning and had marched some ten miles, when,
from a high point on a divide he had reached, which
permitted a full view of the Rocky Mountains from
Pike’s to Long’s Peaks, he observed a horseman galloping
frantically toward them. He was the courier
despatched by Colonel Bankhead. Carpenter was a
splendid soldier. He had received no less than four
brevets for gallantry during the Civil War. He had
been on Sheridan’s staff with Forsyth, and the two were
bosom friends. No task could have been more congenial
to him than this attempt at rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>He communicated the situation of their white comrades
to his black troopers, and their officers crowded
close about him. The orders were received with exultant
cheers. The regiment had been raised since the
war, and had not yet had a chance to prove its mettle.
There were no veterans among them, and Carpenter and
the other officers had been obliged to build the regiment
from the ground up. Now was an opportunity to show
what they could do. Carpenter had been trained to
obey orders to the letter. In this instance he determined
to disobey the command regarding Doctor Fitzgerald.
It appeared to him that Bankhead had little hope that
he (Carpenter) would find Forsyth, for he had sent him
no guide; but Carpenter perceived that if he did find
Forsyth—and he intended to find him—the conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>would be such that the services of a physician
would be vitally necessary. He therefore retained the
doctor. He also retained the wagon train, having no
other way of carrying necessary supplies. For one
reason, if he had detached a guard for the train, it would
have weakened his force so greatly as to have made it
inadequate to the enterprise. The mules were strong
and fresh, and he decided to keep the wagons with him.
The pace was to be a fast one, and he instructed the
wagon masters that, if any of the mule teams gave out,
they should be shot and, if necessary, the wagon should
be abandoned.</p>

<p>Map of Marches to Relieve Colonel Forsyth and to Escort General Carr, Drawn by General Carpenter</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>There was no one in his command, he found, who
had ever been in that territory. Indeed, it is probable
that, save Forsyth’s men, no white men had ever penetrated
that section of the country before. The map that
Carpenter had was very defective. He studied over the
matter a few moments, and then led his command
toward the place where he supposed Forsyth to be.
They advanced at a fast trot, with intervals of walking,
and when they camped at night near some water holes
they had covered nearly forty-five miles. The mules,
under the indefatigable and profane stimulus of their
drivers, had kept up with the rest. As soon as it was
dawn the next day they started once more, and, after a
twenty-mile ride, arrived at the dry bed of a river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether this was the fork of the Republican, on which
Forsyth was besieged, no one could tell. It happens
that the Republican has three forks—a north fork, the
Arickaree, and the south or dry fork. Carpenter was
afraid to leave the fork he had found without satisfying
himself that Forsyth was not there, so he concluded to
scout up the river for some fifteen or eighteen miles.
Finding nothing, he then turned northward again until
he came to a stream flowing through a wide, grass-covered
valley surrounded by high hills. As they entered
the valley they came across a very large, fresh Indian
trail. The scouts estimated that at least two thousand
ponies had passed along the trail within a few hours.
Various other signs showed a large village had moved
down the trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had traveled over forty miles this second day,
and were apprehensive that the Indians, being so close to
them, might attack them. It was nearly evening. A spot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>well adapted for defense was chosen near the water,
the wagons were corralled, and preparations made for
a stout resistance in case of an attack. While the men
were making camp, Carpenter with a small escort rode
to the top of one of the high hills bordering the valley.
He could see for miles, but discovered no Indians nor
any other living object in any direction. In front of
them, however, on the top of another hill, were a number
of scaffolds, each one bearing a human body. The
Cheyenne method of burial was instantly recognized.
A nearer look developed that the scaffolds had been
recently erected. Five of them were examined, and in
each case the body contained was that of a Cheyenne
warrior, who had been killed by a gunshot wound.
This was proof positive that they were some of the Indians
who had been fighting against Forsyth.</p>

<p class='c000'>While this was going on, one of the troopers noticed
something white in a ravine on the opposite side of the
valley. They galloped over to it, and found it to be an
elaborate and beautiful tepee or wigwam, made out of
freshly tanned white buffalo skins. The colonel dismounted,
opened the tepee, and entered. There, upon a
brush heap, lay a human figure wrapped in buffalo robes.
When the robes were taken away the body of a splendid
specimen of Indian manhood was disclosed. “He lay
like a warrior taking his rest, with his martial cloak
around him.” His stern and royal look, the iron majesty
of his features, even though composed in death, revealed
at once a native chieftain. In his breast was a great, gaping
wound, which had pierced his heart. He lay in his
war-gear, with his weapons and other personal property
close at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the examination they recovered him and left
him undisturbed. Then they went back to the camp.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The corral was watchfully guarded during the night,
but no one appeared to molest them. It was decided
to follow the Indian trail at daylight, as it would probably
lead to the site of Forsyth’s fight. Early the next
morning, while they were packing up, they saw some
horsemen coming over the hills to the south of them.
They were white men, led by a scout named Donovan.
Two more men had been despatched by Forsyth from
the island on the third night of the siege, and being
unobserved by the Indians, they had made their way
to Fort Wallace. When they arrived there they found
that Colonel Bankhead had already gone; whereupon
Donovan had assembled five bold spirits and had immediately
started out on the return journey. Fortunately
for Carpenter, Donovan had struck the latter’s trail,
and had followed it to the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carpenter thereupon took thirty of his best mounted
troopers and the ambulance loaded with hardtack,
coffee, and bacon, and set out on a gallop in the direction
in which they supposed the island lay. Banzhaf
was left in command of the rest, with orders to come on
as fast as he could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carpenter went forward at a rapid gallop, and after
traveling eighteen miles, while it was yet early in the
morning, came to a spur of land from which he had
a view of the surrounding country for miles. As he
checked his horse on the brink, he saw to the right of
him a valley through which meandered a narrow silver
stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the center of the valley there was an island. From
it rose a solitary cottonwood. Men could be seen moving
about the place. Donovan recognized it instantly.
The horses of the detachment were put to a run, and the
whole party galloped down the valley toward the island.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The scouts swarmed across the river with cries of joy,
and welcomed the soldiers. The faithful mules dragged
the ambulance close behind. There was food for everybody.
Carpenter was struck with the wolfish look on
the faces of the hungry men as they crowded around the
ambulance. Later one of them brought him a piece of
mule or horse meat which was to have been served for
dinner that day, if the rescuers had not appeared. Carpenter
could not endure even the odor of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Galloping across the river bed, the first to enter the
rifle-pits on the island was Carpenter. There, on the
ground before him, lay Forsyth. And what do you suppose
he was doing? He was reading a novel! Some
one had found, in an empty saddle-bag, an old copy of
<cite>Oliver Twist</cite>. Forsyth was afraid to trust himself. He
was fearful that he would break down. He did not dare
look at Carpenter or express his feelings. Therefore
he made a pretense of being absorbed in his book.</p>

<p class='c000'>The black cavalry had arrived in the very nick of
time. Forsyth was in a burning fever. Blood-poisoning
had set in, and his wounds were in a frightful condition.
Another day and it would have been too late.
Everything was gone from him but his indomitable resolution.
Many others were in like circumstances. It was
well that Carpenter had brought his surgeon with him,
for his services were sadly needed. The men were taken
off the island, moved half a mile away from the terrible
stench arising from the dead animals; the wagon train
came up, camps were made, the dead were buried on
the island they had immortalized with their valor, and
everything possible done for the comfort of the living
by their negro comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor wanted to amputate Forsyth’s leg, but
he protested, so that the amputation was not performed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and the leg was finally saved to its owner. One of the
scouts, named Farley, however, was so desperately
wounded that amputation had to be resorted to. The
doctor performed the operation, assisted by Carpenter.
A military commander in the field has to do a great
many things.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day Bankhead made his appearance with
his detachment. He had marched to the forks of the
river and followed the Arickaree fork to the place. He
was accompanied by two troops of the Second Cavalry,
picked up on the way. He did not find fault with
Carpenter for his disobedience in retaining Doctor
Fitzgerald. On the contrary, such was his delight
at the rescue that he fairly hugged his gallant subordinate.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as it was possible, the survivors were taken
back to Fort Wallace. Forsyth and the more severely
wounded were carried in the ambulance. It took four
days to reach the fort. Their progress was one long
torture, in spite of every care that could be bestowed
upon them. There was no road, and while the drivers
chose the best spots on the prairie, there was, nevertheless,
an awful amount of jolting and bumping.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forsyth was brevetted a brigadier-general in the
Regular Army for his conduct in this action. This was
some compensation for two years of subsequent suffering
until his wounds finally healed.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The End of Roman Nose</h4>

<p class='c020'>On the way back the men stopped at the white tepee
in the lonely valley. Grover and McCall rode over to
the spot with the officers and examined the body of the
chieftain. They instantly identified him as Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Nose. With a touch of sentiment unusual in frontiersmen
they respected his grave, and for the sake of
his valor allowed him to sleep on undisturbed. His
arms and equipments, however, were considered legitimate
spoils of war, and were taken from him. It was a
sad end, indeed, to all his splendid courage and glorious
defiance of his white foemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss of the Indians in the several attacks was
never definitely ascertained. They admitted to seventy-five
killed outright and over two hundred seriously
wounded, but it is certain that their total losses were
much greater. The fighting was of the closest and
fiercest description, and the Indians were under the fire
of one of the most expert bodies of marksmen on the
plains at half pistol-shot distance in the unique and
celebrated battle. The whole action is almost unparalleled
in the history of our Indian wars, both for the
thrilling and gallant cavalry charge of the Indians and
the desperate valor of Forsyth and his scouts.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. A Few Words About Forsyth’s Men</h4>

<p class='c020'>The heroism and pluck of the men in the fight had
been quite up to the mark set by their captain. A
man named Farley had fought through the action with
a severe bullet wound in the shoulder, which he never
mentioned until nightfall; his father was mortally
wounded, but he lay on his side and fought through the
whole of the long first day until he died. Another man
named Harrington was struck in the forehead by an
arrow. He pulled out the shaft, but the head remained
imbedded in the bone. An Indian bullet struck him a
glancing blow in the forehead and neatly extricated the
arrow—rough surgery, to be sure, but it served. Harrington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>tied a rag around his head, and kept his place
during the whole three days of fighting.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they first reached the island one of the men
cried out, “Don’t let’s stay here and be shot down like
dogs! Will any man try for the opposite bank with
me?” Forsyth, revolver in hand, stopped that effort
by threatening to shoot any man who attempted to leave
the island. In all the party there was but one coward.
In looks and demeanor he was the most promising of the
company—a splendid specimen of manhood apparently.
To everybody’s surprise, after one shot he hugged the
earth in his rifle-pit and positively refused to do anything,
in spite of orders, pleadings, jeers, and curses.
He left the troop immediately on its arrival at Fort
Wallace.</p>

<p class='c000'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per contra</span></i>, one of the bravest, where all but one were
heroes, was a little, eighteen-year old Jewish boy, who
had begged to be enlisted and allowed to go along. He
had been the butt of the command, yet he proved himself
a very paladin of courage and efficiency when the fighting
began.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>One of the last acts of the recent Congress was the
setting apart of one hundred and twenty acres of land
in Yuma County, Colorado, as a national park. This
reservation forever preserves Forsyth’s battlefield and
the vicinity from settlement. On the edge of the river
bank, on what was once Beecher’s Island, which the
shifting river has now joined to the bank, is a wooden
monument to Beecher and the other scouts who were
buried somewhere in those shifting sands.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c007'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The few survivors of the battle have formed themselves
into an association which holds an annual reunion
on the battlefield. Soon there will be none of them
left. Would it not be a graceful act for some one who
honors courage, manliness, and devotion to duty to
erect a more enduring monument to the memory of
Beecher and his comrades than the perishable wooden
shaft which now inadequately serves to call attention to
their sacrifice and their valor?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The following interesting communication

<p class='c022'>Dr. Brady says “Donovan had assembled five <em>bold
spirits</em>, and had immediately started out on the return
journey.” As a matter of fact, Donovan did no such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>thing. The departure of General Bankhead’s relief
column stripped the garrison of Fort Wallace to seven
enlisted men, took away the last horse, and placed me
in command. Forsyth’s second note, brought by Donovan,
fell into my hands. It was telegraphed in full to
General Sheridan, who ordered me to spare no expense
of men, money, and horses to hasten relief to Forsyth.
By the promise of $100 each, four citizens of the neighboring
town of Pond Creek were induced to seek the
Carpenter command. Donovan I persuaded to guide
them, promising him $100 in addition to his pay as a
scout. This party started at daylight, on government
mules, rode all day, all night, and found Carpenter’s
command on the south fork of the Republican River,
about ten miles southeast of the scene of the fight.
Guided by these men, Carpenter pushed out, and Forsyth
and his men were relieved some hours in advance
of the arrival of the other relief commands.</p>

<p class='c022'>The country from Fort Wallace to Arickaree Fork I
passed over the following December, in an unsuccessful
endeavor to secure the bodies of those killed in the fight.
We surprised a village of Indians at the scene of the
fight, fought them off, and found the body of one of
the scouts, but Lieutenant Beecher’s and Dr. Mooers’
graves were empty. Yours very truly,</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>By great good fortune I am permitted to insert
here a private letter to me from Mr. Sigmund
Schlesinger, the Jewish boy referred to in
Chapter Six, which, as it contains an original
account of the defense of Beecher’s Island from the
standpoint of one of the participants, is an unique
document in our Western historical records:—C.T.B.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>For several days we had been following an Indian
trail so broad that it looked like a wagon-road. Those
in our command experienced in Indian warfare told us
that we must be on the track of an Indian village on the
move, with a large herd of horses. Evidently they
knew that we were behind them, and seemed to be in
a hurry to get away, for we found camp utensils, tent-poles,
etc., which had been dropped and no time taken
to pick them up. Among other things we saw fresh
antelope meat, quarters, etc., and although our rations
were nearly, if not all, gone, except some coffee and very
little “sow-belly,” we did not dare eat the Indians’
remnants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night of Sept. 16th, before the attack next morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Scout Culver, who was killed next day, pointed out
to a few of us some torch-lights upon the hills that were
being swung like signals. I knew that something “would
be doing” soon, but, like a novice, I was as if on an anxious
seat, under a strain of anticipation, expecting something
strange and dangerous. The next thing that I
now recall was that I was awakened just before daylight
by a single cry, “Indians!” so loud and menacing
that when I jumped up from the ground I was bewildered
and felt as if I wanted to ward off a blow, coming
from I knew not where, for it was still quite dark. That
cry I will never forget. Soon I perceived a commotion
among our horses and mules. The Indians, about a
dozen, tried to stampede them. I could see in the dawning
light the outlines of a white horse in the distance,
and from the noise I realized that they were driving
some of our stock before them. Later, in the daylight
we could recognize some of our ponies on a neighboring
hill in the possession of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as we crossed from the north bank of the
river to the island, just before the attack, we tied our
horses and pack mules to shrubs as best we could.
During the day a mule with a partial pack on his back
got loose and wandered around the vicinity of my pit.
He had several arrows sticking in his body and seemed
wounded otherwise, which caused him to rear and pitch
to such an extent that Jim Lane, my neighbor, and I,
decided to kill him. After shooting him he fell and lay
between us, and served us the double purpose of food
and barricade.</p>

<p class='c000'>My horse was securely tethered to the underbrush on
the island, and later that day I saw the poor beast
rearing and plunging in a death struggle, having been
shot and killed like the rest of our horses and mules.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>He also furnished me with several meals during the siege,
even after he began to putrefy. There was little to
choose between horse and mule meat under such circumstances—both
were abominable.</p>

<p class='c000'>When day broke that Tuesday, the seventeenth of
September, 1868, we saw our pickets riding toward
camp as fast as their horses could carry them, excitedly
yelling: “Indians! Indians!” As I looked up the
valley toward the west I beheld the grandest, wildest
sight—such as few mortals are permitted to see and live
to tell about. Many hundreds of Indians in full war
paraphernalia, riding their splendid war ponies, rushed
toward us <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>. Some were galloping in one direction,
others cantering in another, their lances topped
with many-colored streamers, the fantastic Indian costumes
lending an awful charm to the whole. About
this time those among us who had any had boiled some
coffee and were preparing to cross over to the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will frankly admit that I was awed and scared. I
felt as if I wanted to run somewhere, but every avenue
of escape was blocked. Look where I might I perceived
nothing but danger, which increased my agitation;
so I naturally turned to Colonel Forsyth as a protector,
as a young chick espying the hawk in the air
flutters toward the mother wing. Under such conditions
of strain some things engrave themselves vividly
upon your mind, while others are entirely forgotten. I
remember that distinctly as in my trepidation I instinctively
kept close to the colonel. I was reassured
by his remarkable self-possession and coolness. While
stirring every one to activity round us, he consulted with
Lieutenant Beecher and the guide, Sharp Grover, giving
directions here, advice there, until most of the command
had crossed; then he crossed himself and posted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the men, telling them where to take up their different
positions. Meantime the Indians were coming closer.
I was just behind the colonel when the first shot from
the enemy came flying seemingly over our heads. I
heard him say, smilingly, “Thank you,” but immediately
afterward he ordered every one of us to lie flat upon the
ground, while he, still directing, kept on his feet, walking
around among us, leading his horse. The shots
began coming thicker, and many of us yelled to him to
lie down also. How long after this I do not know,
but I heard the colonel cry out that he was shot,
and I saw him clutch his leg and get down in a sitting
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was lying alongside of Lou McLaughlin; some tall
weeds obscured my vision, so I asked Lou to crouch lower
and I rolled over him to the other side and was there
kept busy with my carbine, for the Indians were onto us.
They were circling around while others were shooting.
Very soon I heard Lou growl and mutter. I looked at
him and saw that he was hit, a bullet coming from the
direction where I was lying struck his gun-sight and
glanced into his breast. He told me what had happened,
but I could give him no attention, for there
seemed lots of work to do before us. But later, after the
repulse of the attack, I looked at Lou and was surprised
to see him lying in a wallow. In his pain he had torn
up the grass and dug his hands into the sand. In answer
to my question whether he was hurt bad, he told
me not bad, and advised me to dig into the sand and
make a hole, as it would be a protection.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>I am not sure at this time, but I am now under the
impression that I told Colonel Forsyth of this; and from
that time on we began to dig with our hands or whatever
we could use, and kick with our heels and toes in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the sand, and some of us soon had holes dug deep
enough to protect the chest, at least.</p>

<p class='c000'>Time seemed out of our calculations. I heard some
one call, “What time is it?” An answer came, “Three
o’clock.” I had thought it was about ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> We had
nothing to eat or drink all day and, strange to say, I
was not hungry, which may have been the reason why
I thought it was still early. Word was passed that
Lieutenant Beecher and Scouts Wilson and Culver were
killed, Colonel Forsyth wounded again, also Doctor
Mooers shot in the head and others hurt whose names I
do not now remember.</p>

<p class='c000'>We fought steadily all day. After dark the Indians
withdrew; then nature began to assert itself. I got
hungry; there was nothing to eat in the camp that I knew
of, except some wild plums that I had gathered the day
before, which were in my saddle-bags, still on the body
of my horse. I got out of my hole, creeping on hands
and knees toward where I knew the poor animal lay.
As I felt my way in the darkness I touched something
cold, and upon examination found that it was Wilson’s
dead hand. He lay where he fell; it was a most horrible
feeling. The shivers ran up and down my back, but I
got to my horse at last, and tugging, I finally secured the
bag and my plums. I also found in it a piece of bacon,
the size of two fingers, which I reserved for a last emergency,
and was still in possession of that rusty piece of
fat when relief came.</p>

<p class='c000'>On my way back to my hole I passed one where Doctor
Mooers lay wounded, moaning piteously. I put a
plum in his mouth, and I saw it between his teeth next
morning. He died on the night of the 19th. All our
wounded were very cheerful, and to look at Colonel Forsyth
and talk to him as he lay there helpless, no outsider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>would have suspected that he was crippled. We used
to gather round him in his pit and hold conversation, not
like men in a desperate situation, but like neighbors
talking over a common cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Forsyth was the right man in command of
such a heterogeneous company. Like the least among
us, he attended to his own horse when in camp, and
many times have I seen him gather buffalo chips to
supply the mess fuel. While he was our commander in
practice he was our friend, and as such we respected
him, followed and obeyed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>On about the fifth day, as the Indians began leaving
us, we began to walk about and look around. About
fifteen or twenty feet from my pit I noticed a few of our
men calling to the rest of us. I ran to the place, and
there, against the edge of the island, I saw three dead
Indians. Their friends evidently could not reach them
to carry them off, which explained to us the persistent
fighting in this direction. When I got there the Indians
were being stripped of their equipments, scalps, etc.
One of them was shot in the head and his hair was clotted
with blood. I took hold of one of his braids and applied
my knife to the skin above the ear to secure the
scalp, but my hand coming in contact with the blood,
I dropped the hair in disgust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jim Lane saw my hesitation, and taking up the
braid, said to me: “My boy, does it make you sick?”
Then inserting the point of the knife under the skin, he
cut around, took up the other braid, and jerked the scalp
from the head. I had been about three years in that
country and four years in America, and life on the plains
under such hardships as I had undergone hardens the
sensibility, yet I was not quite ripe for such a cutting
affray, even with a dead Indian.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>After this we were not molested, but devoted our time
to looking around for something to eat besides the rotten
horse and mule meat, which we boiled several times in
water and powder, not to get it soft, but to boil out the
stench as much as possible. We found some cactus
fruit, and killed a coyote, of which the brains and a rib
were my portion. Aside from this we had nothing but
horse and mule during the siege, which soon told on
our bowels; but in spite of all this, I do not remember a
despondent man in our crowd.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning, being the ninth since we were attacked,
I was lying outside of my pit, having done some guard
duty during the night; I was half dozing and dreaming
of home and a good meal. I felt so homesick and so
hungry when I heard some one call attention to something
moving on the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was all attention at once. Soon I heard again “I
think that’s Doctor Fitzgerald’s greyhound.” Whoever
it might be, we would welcome. We would even have
been pleased to have the Indians attack us again, in
hopes of killing one of their horses for fresh meat; but
it was soon evident that help was coming, and when I
fully realized this fact, enfeebled as I was, I jumped up
and joined in a lunatics’ dance that was in progress all
around us. Those on the hill must have seen us, for
there was a rush of horsemen down the hill toward us,
followed by one or two ambulance wagons.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were as eager to reach us as we were to greet
them, and as I ran uphill I noticed a soldier on a white
horse coming full tilt. The momentum carried him
past me, but in passing I grabbed his saddle-bag and
was taken off my feet, but it would have taken more than
one horse to drag me from my hold. I suspected some
eatables in there, and as soon as he could stop, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>dismounting he assisted me to open that bag. With
both hands I dived in, and with each hand I clutched
some hardtack, but only one hand could reach my
mouth; my other was in the grip of one of our men,
who ravenously snatched the “tacks.” We ate, cried,
laughed, and ate, all in a breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as possible we put our dead in the ground.
Those that died at one end of the island were cared for
by those in that vicinity, and others in their vicinity, so
that one part of the island was not aware of the location
of the corpses of the other part; at least I did not know
where the bodies lay of those killed on the eastern end
of the island. So one time, as I walked around among
the pits, I noticed something red and round sticking out
of the sand, like a half-buried red berry. I kicked it,
but by so doing it was not dislodged; I kicked again, but
to no result. I then looked closer and discovered that
it was the nose of a dead man. I called others to my
assistance, and we fixed matters so that no desecration
was possible again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our mortally wounded were made as comfortable as
possible before they died. I assisted at such ministrations
given to Lieutenant Beecher. We removed his
boots, coat, etc., and, of course, these things were not replaced
on the body after he was dead, but lay around
unnoticed. My shoes were quite badly worn, especially
after being used for digging in the sand, so when relief
came and we were preparing to leave the island, I
put on his shoes, which were just about my size, and wore
them even after I got back to New York City, leaving
my old shoes in their stead on the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one of our “sittings” around Colonel Forsyth in
his pit, the incident of killing the coyote was discussed,
and plans were suggested for the killing of more of them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Along with others, I also suggested a scheme, but it
was ridiculed, and I soon retired to my pit, which was
near enough to the colonel’s, so that I could hear what
was said there. One of the men remaining was saying
uncomplimentary things about me, when the colonel
silenced him, telling him that I was but a boy unused
to such things and that, under the circumstances, I was
doing better than some of the older men. Colonel
Forsyth is unconscious of the fact that I am very grateful
to him for his kindness to that strange “boy” among
those strangers, and that I still hope some day that I
may have the opportunity to show my appreciation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jack Stillwell and I were the only boys in the company,
and naturally gravitated toward each other. We
were friends as soon as we met and chums before we
knew each other’s names. When the colonel asked for
volunteers to go to Fort Wallace for help, Jack was
among the first to announce himself. I wanted to go
with him, but the colonel gave no heed to my request;
even Jack discouraged me, for he knew I was too inexperienced.
After Colonel Carpenter came to our relief
Jack was not with him, which made me and others feel
very uneasy. The day after Colonel Carpenter’s arrival
we saw the mounted sentinel that had been posted by
Colonel Carpenter on a high eminence in the hills about
three miles from the island, signaling that a body of men
was approaching, which created a flutter of excitement,
but there was a strong sensation of security, mingled
with a sense of dependence upon our black rescuers
permeating our emaciated party, after being cooped up,
so to say, for so long a period in dread and suspense. At
least that was my sensation. I remember watching that
vedette, horse and rider turning around and around,
being the only moving object in that dim distance, indicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to the anxious watchers that either friend or foe
was in the vicinity. As he showed no inclination to leave
his post, it was soon evident he had no fear of the approaching
column, and that friends were coming. Not
long after a few horsemen were seen coming around the
bend of the river bed, and among them was my friend
Jack Stillwell. Nearly all of us ran to meet the party.
Soon Jack jumped from his horse, and in his joy to see
so many of us alive again, he permitted his tears free flow
down his good honest cheeks. I kept up correspondence
with him all these years past. Last year he died.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
He was a big-hearted, jovial fellow, brave to a fault.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Carpenter had performed a very commendable
thing in his march of over one
hundred miles in two days for the relief of
Forsyth. And it is marvelous that he had
been able to find him in that vast expanse of country.
He received high praise for it, which he fully deserved;
but the battle which, with his black comrades,
he fought three weeks later, elicited still more
praise. The fight was one of the prettiest and most
typical of any in our Indian campaigns; and I am
fortunate in being able to give it in General Carpenter’s
own words, written especially for this book, the notes
appended being my own contribution.—C. T. B.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>While on the forced march to relieve the party of
scouts with Colonel George A. Forsyth, surrounded by
Indians on the Arickaree fork of the Republican River,
the troops under my command discovered a large trail
of the Indians who had been engaged in that fight
on the south fork of the Republican.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The scouts discovered that this trail left the valley
of the stream a short distance below and struck across
country in the direction of the Beaver Creek. After the
relief of Forsyth, on my return to Fort Wallace with the
survivors and wounded, a report was made to General
Sheridan, then to the east of Fort Hayes, Kansas, of the
probable whereabouts of the Indians; and the Fifth
Cavalry, which had just arrived from the East by rail,
was disembarked between Hayes and Wallace and ordered
to move north under Major Royall, and strike the
savages, if possible, on the Beaver. A day or two after
the Fifth had left, Brevet-Major-General Eugene A.
Carr reported for duty to General Sheridan. Carr had
been a general officer of volunteers during the Civil War
with an excellent record, and now reverted to his rank
in the regulars of Major in the Fifth Cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sheridan was anxious to have Carr join his regiment
because of his experience with Indians and his general
reputation, and therefore sent him to Fort Wallace with
orders to have the two troops of cavalry there go under
my command and escort Carr and overtake the Fifth,
if possible, to enable him to join his regiment. The
troops consisting of Troops H and I, Tenth Cavalry,
were officered by myself and Captain Graham, Lieutenants
Banzhaf, Amick, and Orleman, and were soon in
readiness for the duty required. We had returned from
the relief of Forsyth Oct. 1st, and we started with Carr
at ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> Oct. 14th.</p>

<p class='c000'>I concluded to march north so as to strike the Beaver
as soon as possible, and then to follow down that creek
with the expectation of finding the Fifth Cavalry or of
striking its trail. On the 15th I reached the Beaver at
about one <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span>, and after proceeding some miles down,
went into bivouac. As we expected, we found a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>large Indian trail about two weeks old, over which over
two thousand head of ponies had been ridden or driven,
going in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day we continued our journey down the
stream, finding plenty of water, a fine bottom covered
with grass and timber, and still observing the Indian
trail, which ran to a point about twenty miles east from
the place where we first struck the Beaver. At this locality
the signs showed that the Indians had encamped
for the night. The ground was covered for acres with
old fire-places, pieces of wood, and the manure of ponies;
and a little distance off we found a dead Cheyenne,
wrapped in his robes, lying upon a scaffolding in a tree,
a protection against ravenous wolves. The trail then
struck south toward Short Nose Creek, the Indian name
for a stream about twenty miles south of the Beaver.
We continued our course, however, on the Beaver, until
we made about thirty miles, and then stopped for the
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>As there was no pack outfit at Wallace, I was compelled
to take wagons to carry our supplies, and had
eleven with me. The mules, dragging heavy loads over
rough country, were made to trot in order to keep up
with the cavalry column. We had now moved down
the Beaver about forty-five miles without finding anything
about the Fifth, and it began to look as if something
had taken the regiment in another direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning I sent Lieutenant Amick and ten
men well mounted with Sharp Grover, the famous scout,
with orders to proceed as quickly as possible across
country to the Short Nose to look for signs of the Fifth
Cavalry and to keep a sharp lookout for Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grover, who, it will be remembered, had been with
Forsyth, afterward joined my command. He had married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>a Sioux woman and had lived for years with the
Indians before the outbreak of hostilities. He could
speak their language and knew their ways and customs,
and was perfectly trained in reading signs. It was interesting
to see how he could read what the tracks meant,
as if they had been books. He could tell how long since
the tracks were made, whether they were made by horses
or ponies, shod or unshod, how many were ridden,
how many were driven, whether it was a war party or a
party changing camp. If Indians stopped for the night
he could tell how many men or squaws were in the party,
to what tribe they belonged, from the shape of their
moccasins, and many more details. Like most of his
ilk, Grover drank heavily on occasion. When the Indians
went on the war-path Grover could not stay longer
with the Sioux, as his life was not safe, and he entered
the government employ, where he rendered heroic and
invaluable services. Later he was killed in a row at
Pond City, near Fort Wallace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amick and his party soon disappeared over the hills
to our right and we kept on down the stream, the general
course of which was to the northeast. I began to feel certain
that the Fifth Cavalry had never reached the Beaver,
and that we would probably be attacked by the Indians
if this was the case. Under these circumstances I felt
that it would be wise to be cautious and on the lookout
against surprise. The road we passed over was very
rough and the stream in most places ran through deep-cut
banks several feet high, with very few places suitable
for crossing.</p>

<p class='c000'>As night came on a place was selected for a camp in a
bend of the creek where the wagons could be placed
across, giving room inside to graze the animals without
fear of a stampede from howling savages. Amick returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>just before night, having scouted some miles
beyond the Short Nose without discovering any trace of
the Fifth Cavalry. Grover told me that as they passed
across the divide between the Beaver and the Short
Nose he came across a single Indian pony track. This
track was coming from a direction to our rear, and
showed that the pony was going at a rapid gallop.
Grover inferred from this that it was probably an Indian
hunter returning homeward who had most likely
crossed our trail behind us, discovered our presence in
the country, and was riding as fast as possible to carry
the news to the Indian camps somewhere to our front
and not far off.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a council over the situation General Carr came
to the conclusion, after having traveled some sixty miles
down the Beaver without finding the Fifth, that the regiment
had never reached that stream and that therefore
he would give it up and start on our return in the morning.
About seven <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the next day, Oct. 15th,
Captain Graham expressed a wish to make a scout for
a short distance to the front, and rode forward with two
men. The command was ordered saddled up and everything
made in readiness to move. In view of the fact
that the south side of the creek was hilly and difficult
and offered opportunities for ambuscades, I determined
to go back by the north side, which was comparatively
open. The afternoon before I had sent Lieutenant
Orleman with a detachment to dig down the sides of the
creek and prepare a practicable passage for the wagons
and troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Graham had hardly ridden a thousand yards when
twenty-five Indians suddenly dashed over the hill to his
rear, with the evident intention of cutting him off. They
were almost upon Graham before he discerned them, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>he instantly struck spurs into his horse and dashed for
the creek, the Indians firing a volley at short range upon
the party. One of the bullets passed through Graham’s
hat, another through his coat, and a third through his
leggings without wounding him. One of the horses was
shot through the shoulder and fell. His rider succeeded
in getting into the creek and behind the bank along with
the other soldiers, and they commenced firing upon the
Indians. Graham’s girth burst as his horse sprang
away at the first fire, but as his saddle gave way he seized
his horse’s mane and dragged himself forward on the
animal. He then dashed the horse over the bank of the
creek, about ten feet to the bottom. He fell from his
horse in this jump, but the horse, fortunately, ran in
our direction.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By this time I started out thirty men under Lieutenants
Amick and Orleman to cover the retreat of Graham’s
men. As they charged toward the hill the savages rushed
from the creek to avoid being cut off, and were hotly pursued
by our men. Judging that the presence of these
Indians indicated that a large party could not be far
off, I thought it best to be prudent and sent a trumpeter
to overtake Amick and tell him to discontinue the pursuit
and fall back slowly to camp. Without further
delay I now broke up the camp, crossed the creek with
wagons and troops, and, having dismounted the men, deployed
them as riflemen to cover the retreat of Amick.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes the absent party made its appearance
on the hills, with bodies of Indians, numbering at
least a hundred, skirmishing on our flank and rear.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>They slowly fell back toward the creek, and when within
range the dismounted men on the banks opened fire on
the advancing savages, and under cover of this Amick
crossed and joined the command, while the Indians
kept at a respectful distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wagons were now placed in double column
so as to make everything as compact as possible.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
H Troop was assigned on the flanks and advance,
deployed in open order. Troop I covered the rear in
the same manner, with one platoon under Graham as
a reserve. These arrangements being completed, we
moved steadily up the creek bottom. As soon as this
movement commenced, a large body of Indians made
their appearance and charged toward us, taking advantage
of ravines, trees, and bluffs to fire from the south
side of the creek. Some of the balls were well aimed
and came close.</p>

<p class='c000'>I soon saw that if we continued down the creek bottom
the enemy would harass us immensely under cover
of the timber and banks, and therefore changed our
course so as to leave the valley and take the higher
ground or divide. The Indians followed, showing
about two hundred strong, and acted boldly in their
attacks on the rear and flanks. The men and officers
behaved very coolly, facing toward the enemy and driving
them back without stopping the progress of the
column.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>At one point we passed near a deep ravine, and the
enemy, quick to observe cover of any kind, occupied it
with quite a number of warriors and opened up a serious
fire. The reserve platoon under Graham charged
at the place as we were passing and, arriving at the edge
of the ravine, poured in a volley at close range on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>savages. A number must have been hurt and the Indians
certainly lost no time in getting out of their position.
Afterward they were more cautious in occupying
ground too close to us. The flankers, under Banzhaf
and Orleman, also repulsed the Indians on several occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>One Indian carried a red flag with some white device
upon it, and by his movements the whole force seemed
more or less governed. They were all stripped to the
waists, and were decorated by various ornaments hanging
from their heads and their shields, quivers, and bridles,
so as to glisten and shine in the sun at every turn
of the ponies. Up to this time five Indians were known
to be killed at various points and quite a number
wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> the enemy seemed to stop the fight and
apparently withdrew, and I supposed that I had seen the
last of them; but half an hour afterward, hearing an exclamation,
I looked back and saw the Indians appearing
again on the hills to our rear. On they came, one body
after another coming in sight until it was estimated by all
present that at least six hundred warriors were in view.
Emboldened by their number they rushed forward, directing
themselves toward our front, flanks and rear,
making things look rather serious. I soon saw that we
could not continue the march and meet this force, but
that we must select a position and make a stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first attack in the morning I had offered the
command to General Carr, as the senior officer present,
but he declined it, stating that he considered himself
simply as a passenger to be escorted, and I therefore
continued to direct the operations.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>I looked around and saw a small knoll or rise a short
distance to the front, from which the ground fell in
every direction, and this point was immediately selected.
The teamsters were directed to take the trot, aim for
this place, and on arrival at the knoll immediately to
form a circular corral, half a circle on either side, with
the mules facing inward, affording a shelter within and
something of a fortification. As soon as we increased
our pace the Indians evidently thought we were running
from them, and sent up a yell which made shivers
run down the backs of some of our recruits. We kept
on, however, at a fast gait, and the moment we struck
the highest ground, the wagons were corralled with six
wagons one side, five wagons on the other, and the
troops were rushed inside at a gallop and dismounted.
The horses were tied together inside the corral with
some men to watch them, and the rest were formed outside
the corral in open order.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a> This was done in about
two minutes and then the advance of the Indians was
upon us.</p>

<p>THE CHIEF MEDICINE MAN AT BEAVER CREEK<br /><br /><em>Drawing by Will Crawford</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A fire commenced from our seven-shooter Spencers
which sounded like the fire of a line of infantry. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Indians charged up around the wagons, firing rapidly
and seriously wounded some of the men, but in a very
short time they were driven back in wild disorder, leaving
the ground covered with ponies, arms, and some
bodies. Three dead warriors lay within fifty feet of the
wagons. One man who was killed here was carried off
by his comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief Medicine Man, on a fine looking horse, rode
out in front of our line about two hundred yards off,
after the retreat of the Indians, to try to show that
his medicine was good and the white man’s bullets
could not hurt him. I directed several men near me
to aim carefully at him. They fired and the Medicine
Man went down, accompanied by a howl from the more
distant Indians. After the repulse the men rushed forward
from the wagons, seized and hauled in ten bodies
of the Indians. The savages, disheartened and surprised
at this reception, withdrew out of gunshot and
assembled, apparently for council.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The men carried corn sacks and made breastworks
near the wagons and we waited, expecting a renewal of
the attack, for about an hour, when it became evident
that some of the Indians were withdrawing. The day
was very warm, we had been engaged about eight hours,
and in the hot sun men and animals were suffering very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>much from thirst. I made up my mind to move for
water, and keeping the wagons in double column, the
horses inside and the men dismounted on the outside,
we marched for the Beaver. A large party of Indians
followed up to where their dead comrades lay and set
up a mournful howl over their remains. Their loss in
this fight, added to what they had suffered the month
before in the conflict with Forsyth, must have had a
sobering effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now proceeded to the creek without further interference,
and selecting a wide bottom encamped for the
night, preparing some rifle-pits to cover our outlying
pickets and to enable them to receive the enemy if an
attack were made in the morning. We heard them
around us all night imitating coyotes, but they did not
find a weak place and refrained from molesting us.
The next morning the Indians were gone and we
marched by the shortest route to Fort Wallace, arriving
there on the 21st.</p>

<p class='c000'>On our return journey we passed through Sheridan
City, a frontier town located at the then terminus of the
Kansas Division of the Union Pacific R. R. It was full
of taverns, saloons, gambling houses and dens, and of
a rather tough lot of citizens and desperadoes. These
people and others crowded into the streets when we
passed through, and when they saw the troopers and
their horses decorated with the spoils from the Indians
whose dead bodies we had captured, they knew that we
had been in a successful fight and they gave us a perfect
ovation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages suffered a considerable loss, but we escaped
with a few men wounded (some of them seriously)
and none killed. General Carr found the Fifth Cavalry
had returned to the railroad, and through mistake they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>never reached the Beaver. He took command of the
regiment, marched again and pursued the Indians over
the Platte River, and followed them on a long campaign.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>This was one of the smartest and most successful Indian
fights on record. Carpenter’s tactics throughout
had been admirable. General Carr was much surprised
and pleased at the conduct of these black troopers,
and on his return to Fort Wallace telegraphed to
General Sheridan that “the officers and troops behaved
admirably.” General Sheridan published a general
order highly commending the commander, the officers
and the men for this brilliant and gallant affair. Carpenter
was brevetted colonel in the Regular Army (his
fifth brevet), and afterward received a medal of honor
for this fight and the relief of Forsyth. Well did he
deserve them both.—C. T. B.</p>

interfere with Carpenter’s arrangements; with rare self-restraint he refrained even from
offering suggestions. Although he showed plenty of nerve and was entirely calm and
collected throughout the hot affair, he is reported to have said after the fight that he
thought he was in the tightest box in which he was ever caught in his life, and that there
was nothing left for them all to do but to sell their lives as dearly as possible. He had
never served on the plains with negro troopers before, and had no knowledge as to how
they would behave against Indians—nobody had, for that matter.—C. T. B.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When there are many wagons, the corral is formed with the wagons close together,
axles touching, tongues and mules inward; but in this case they had to form an open
corral with about twenty feet between the wagons. The horses, to the number of one
hundred—the troops being reduced to that number by illness, hard work, and other
causes—were forced inside the wagons in columns of four, each set of fours being tied
together, with horse-holders detailed to look after them. The duty of the horse-holders
was most important. They had always to be on watch to prevent a stampede.
If the troops had been deprived of their horses on that open knoll their position
would have been hopeless indeed. The dismounted men were formed in front and rear
and on both sides of the corral, as Indian attacks must be expected from every direction.
The plan made by General Carpenter explains the situation perfectly.—C. T. B.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r44'>44</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Just after the first repulse of the Indians, Graham went to General Carr very improperly
(he had no business to communicate with him except through Carpenter, his
immediate commanding officer), and suggested that he order the wagons abandoned,
the teamsters mounted on the mules, and the whole party to retreat in that fashion as
fast as possible. Carr, of course, referred the matter to Carpenter, who promptly refused
to sanction any such manœuver. To leave the wagons, which afforded some protection
on the hill, would be to enable six or seven hundred Indians to surround the hundred
troopers in his command and invite annihilation. Carpenter assured Carr that as
he had defeated the Indians once, he was certain that he could do it again. Carr wisely
persisted in his determination not to interfere, and Graham had his suggestion decisively
negatived by Carpenter. Graham deserved reprobation for his unmilitary action,
<em>as well as for his foolish suggestion</em>.—C.T.B.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER NINE<br /> <span class='large'>A Further Discussion of the Beaver Creek Affair</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>When General Carpenter’s account of the
fight on the Beaver Creek was published
serially, General Carr took exception to it in
a public letter to the editor of the periodical
in which it appeared. I am permitted by the editor to
make extracts from this letter, which, with my own comment
and General Carpenter’s rejoinder, appear as
follows:</p>

<h4 class='c019'>I. General Carr’s Account</h4>

<p class='c020'>I do not think that General Sheridan sent orders for
my escort to go under command of Colonel Carpenter.
I know that, after waiting with General Sheridan at
Fort Hayes for several days, he ordered me to go to
Fort Wallace, take an escort and go to find Royall, who
had not been heard from as expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were going over the “rough hills” Colonel
Carpenter, and perhaps some of the others, came up and
remonstrated with me for marching the command so
hard; said they could not be responsible for its effect
on the horses, and when I insisted, asked me to take
command and be responsible. I said, “All right, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>will take command; but you must attend to the details.
I will not appoint an adjutant and take the office work”
(detailing guards, stable duties, etc., etc.).</p>

<p class='c000'>I had with me an officer of my regiment, Captain
Kane, Fifth Cavalry, and now wish I had appointed him
adjutant and taken formal command.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding that the stream (Beaver Creek) was persistently
hugging the south side of the valley, on which we
were traveling, creating bluffs and ravines over which it
was difficult to move the wagons, I determined to cross
to the north side, where the valley consisted of a gentle
and smooth slope.</p>

<p class='c000'>I selected the camp in an “ox bow” bend of the creek,
putting the tents and wagons across the entrance, the
guard at the bow and the animals inside, selected a place
for crossing, and ordered the banks to be cut down to the
bed of the creek, so that the wagons and animals could
cross.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Indian country I always had my commands up
and under arms before daylight, which is the most dangerous
time; and next morning we were up, had breakfast,
the tents struck and the wagons packed, and were
standing ’round the camp fire when Amick called out
“Indians!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I had intended to move camp across the creek and get
fresh grass. Graham had started on his trip, following
a narrow path between the bluff and the river bank.
He was riding a fine horse called “Red Eye,” which had
a very deep chest and thin barrel. As he told me afterward,
his saddle began to slip back, but he waited to get
down to fix it till he should reach a more open place
ahead at the mouth of a ravine, when <em>bang, bang!</em> came
some shots. His horse dodged and jumped down the
bank into the creek, slipping the saddle farther back and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>kicking it clear, while Graham landed on the shoulders
of the horse and from there on the bed of the creek.
He turned back with his gun toward the bank, which
protected him while he fired, till I sent Lieutenant
Amick with some skirmishers, who covered his retreat.
His two men jumped their horses down into and up out
of the creek and fell back, and when we got the men all
in I moved the command up to and over the crossing I
had prepared and out to the open slope on the north side
of the valley. As we had not found Royall but had
found the Indians, or, rather, they had found us, it was of
no use to go farther down the Beaver, and I determined
to move toward home.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians kept coming out from those bluffs, crossing
the creek and following us, and I arranged the wagons
in two columns, with Carpenter’s company in front
and on the flanks, and Graham’s company in rear, where
I was also.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the Indians got on our flanks as skirmishers,
a few in front and more in rear, while the main body got
into two columns, about like the two halves of a regiment
in columns of four, marching steadily and gradually,
closing on us by increasing their gait. I estimated
them at seven hundred warriors; we had about one hundred
colored soldiers. Their chiefs were marching between
the heads of their columns; they had a flag and a
bugle. I sent word to Carpenter to turn more toward
the higher ground, away from the timber along the creek,
which Indians were using for cover. Pretty soon he began
to trot, and I had to send Captain Kane to him with
orders to go slower, for fear of a stampede. I was in the
rear near Graham’s troop. He was one of the bravest
men I ever saw. He would amuse himself with the Indians
by concealing men in hollows, taking away their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>horses till Indians came up for them to shoot at, then
charging up with their horses, mounting and bringing
them off. Most of the men were cool, but I saw one
man loading and firing when the Indians were a mile
away. I called to him to stop, but he paid no attention,
seemed to be dazed, and I had to go up and lay my hand
on him before he obeyed my order. As the Indians got
closer, one of the men dismounted to shoot. When he
tried to remount, his horse got scared and edged away
from him, and I rode up on the off-side, got hold of the
rein, and let his horse come against mine. Then he put
his foot in the stirrup, made a leap and got his leg over,
when we both cantered off—just in time. He lost his
cap, and we lost a dog which was playing about between
us and the Indians, interested in the shooting till
he got near enough to them to be killed. These were
our only losses.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the main body of the Indians got closer and increased
their gait to the charge, the leading wagons
turned toward each other and stopped. The others
turned their mules inside of those in front of them, lapping
onto and tying to the wagons, forming a corral in
shape of a flat-iron, and the horsemen rode inside, dismounted,
tied their horses, and began to fire at the
Indians who were thronging around us. One Indian,
on a clay-bank pony and wearing a red blanket, with no
arms, rode ’round and ’round us within fifty or one hundred
yards, and seemed to bear a charmed life. I shot at
him several times, and Grover said he also shot at him
till he began to think the Indian had strong medicine
which protected him—Grover was a squaw man and
had imbibed some of their superstitions. He was shooting
a Sharp’s carbine, and, taking it down to reload,
happened to notice that he had the sight set for five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>hundred yards and had been shooting over the
Indian’s head.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had a Spencer carbine which had been sent me by
the company for trial. With it I shot down an Indian,
who fell and lay within thirty yards of the corral. He
was not dead, and I afterward talked with him through
Grover. He said his name was Little Crow, and mentioned
the name of his father, whom Grover said he
knew. He was young—about eighteen. I asked him
why they attacked us. He said because we came on
their creek. He told where their camp was, so that
one week from that day, which was Sunday, October
18th, 1868, I found them with my own regiment, the
Fifth, had a fight lasting two days and two nights, and
drove them out of Kansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the fight was going on our soldiers showed
great bravery. While inside the wagon corral they
would rush from one side to the other, wherever the Indians
appeared, so as to fire at them. Their officers
did not seem to keep them in their places, and, after
it was over, I reprimanded them for not commanding
their men. After the Indians were repulsed we went
around and rearranged the wagons, got out sacks,
cracker-boxes, etc., fixed breastworks in anticipation
of another attack, and then sat down and ate our lunch.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was two o’clock. Our soldiers wanted to scalp the
dead Indians, of whom about ten were lying too near
the corral for their friends to carry off. We prevented
this till, while we were going around the corral rearranging,
the soldiers got the chance to scalp them. Two
were lying wounded when two soldiers approached
them; one drew his bow and sent an arrow through the
thighs of one of the men. The arrow passed through
the fleshy part of one thigh and entered the other and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>stopped against the bone. It had to be cut in two to
extract it. Years after, at Fort Leavenworth, a first sergeant
showed me an arrow-head with the point marred,
and said he was that man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other wounded Indian had a pistol, and shot the
other soldier in the calf of his leg. These were the only
men we had hurt. It was then that there was some
talk of abandoning the wagons and going direct for the
railroad. With the wagons, we had, of course, to go by
routes over which wheeled vehicles could travel. I do
not recall whether Captain Graham advocated this, but
there would have been no impropriety in his stating his
views to me. Any officer can talk to his commander,
and I had been giving orders from time to time directly
to him and his men. We sat there eating our lunch and
talking with each other and the wounded Indian who lay
in front of us, when he made a motion with his hand
back toward me. I asked Grover what he meant.
He said, “He wants you to go away; says his heart is
bad.” This pleased me very much. I had been watching
the Indians, who had fallen back to some rising
ground nearly a mile off. They were moving about,
pow-wowing, and, I supposed, preparing for a new attack.
They seemed to be diminishing in numbers, but
I thought they were trying to get around to some place
where they would have a better chance at us. I really
did not expect to get out of that fix. If those Indians
had had sufficient resolution, being seven to one, they
ought to have used us up. When the wounded Indian
made this motion, I took it to mean that he knew they
were giving up. He could see them as well as we could,
and knew better what they were doing. I suppose that
those who remained were the friends of the dead, waiting
for us to go.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>I gave orders to reload the wagons and move out.
Some of the Indians followed us for several miles, but
did not again attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Carpenter did not offer the command to me
at the first attack in the morning, nor did I decline it.
I was exercising the command all the time. One of the
articles of war provides that “when troops join and do
duty together the highest in rank of the line of the army
shall command the whole, and give the orders needful
for the service,” and I could not have avoided the responsibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing narrative shows that I was not a “passive
spectator,” nor did I “refrain from advice or suggestion,”
nor from giving orders as required.</p>

<p class='c000'>I, no doubt, said that I was a guest, and did not interfere
unnecessarily; but my long experience on the plains
and with Indians rendered it incumbent on me to exercise
my judgment.</p>

</div>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>With reference to this letter from General Carr I beg
to point out:</p>

<p class='c000'>That General Carr in his letter practically admits in
two places that he was not in command. First, when
he writes of Captain Kane, “I wish I had appointed him
adjutant and taken formal command.” Second, when
he writes: “I, no doubt, said that I was a guest, and
did not interfere unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not see, therefore, that there is really any serious
discrepancy between the account of General Carpenter
and that of General Carr. I presume, if there is, I am
more to blame than any one for the note to which General
Carr takes exception. The original wording of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that note was, possibly, not happy, and probably conveyed
more than I intended. I did not suppose that
any one thought that General Carr sat around and
twiddled his thumbs while the fighting was going on.
I have made changes in the note, which appears in this
book in its amended form.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must not be forgotten that General Carpenter received
his medal of honor in part for this fight, and he
certainly would not have received it had he not been in
command.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here follows a communication from General Carpenter
on the subject. This discussion, I think, settles the
matter in a way which I trust will be satisfactory to the
friends of both of these distinguished officers.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. General Carpenter’s Reply</h4>

<p class='c020'>I was very much surprised in reading General Carr’s
contention that he was in command of the troops who
constituted his escort to enable him to join the Fifth
Cavalry, and who were in the action on the Beaver in
October, 1868. The account I wrote is from my recollection,
and from letters written home at the time, and I
repeated what I thought there was no question about,
and had no desire to ignore General Carr or any one
concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two troops of the Tenth Cavalry, a portion of the
garrison at Fort Wallace, under my command as the
senior officer, were ordered to act as escort for General
Carr, then Major, Fifth Cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am quite positive that General Carr was offered the
command by me, knowing him to be senior, and that
he declined it. Many officers have been escorted by
troops without taking command of the escort although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of senior rank. As the troops were to escort this officer,
of course he was consulted about the direction of the
march, the time for camping, and concerning many
other details of greater or less importance, but he never
took formal command. If he did not, then, it would be
manifestly improper for him to issue orders directly to
subordinate officers or men. The officers and men were
mentioned in General Orders by General Sheridan in
1868 for their gallantry and bravery in this action, and
it is stated that they were escorting General Carr.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirty-five years have passed since the affair, and I
never heard of any question about who commanded the
troops engaged. This length of time naturally accounts
for some difference of memory, and no two narratives
may be expected altogether to agree. As mentioned
before, Carr was consulted frequently during the expedition
and his wishes were carried out, as was proper
under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the details mentioned by General Carr I do
not remember, but I certainly regarded myself as being
in command of the troops during the fight and gave directions
as I have stated in accordance with my recollection,
and selected the ground on which the wagons were
corralled and the Indians repulsed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not know of any officers being reprimanded,
but when we returned to Fort Wallace we were informed
that General Carr had reported to General
Sheridan that “the officers and men had behaved
admirably,”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inclose a copy of General Field Orders, No. 4,
Headquarters Department of the Missouri, dated
October 27, 1868, issued by order of General Sheridan
to commend the conduct of the troops engaged in the
combat on the Beaver, October 18, 1868:</p>

<p class='c022'>The attention of the officers and soldiers of this department is
called to the engagement with hostile Indians on Beaver Creek,
Kansas, October 18, 1868, in which a detachment of cavalry (escorting
Brevet Major-Gen’l E. A. Carr, Major, Fifth Cavalry to his
Regiment) under the command of Brevet Lieut.-Col. Louis H.
Carpenter, Captain, Tenth Cavalry, consisting of Companies I, Tenth
Cavalry, under Capt. George W. Graham and 1st Lieut.-Major J.
Amick, and H, Tenth Cavalry, under 1st Lieut. Charles Banzhaf
and 2d Lieut. Louis H. Orleman, engaged about five hundred (500)
Indians for several hours, inflicting a loss on the savages of ten (10)
killed and many wounded, losing three (3) enlisted men wounded.</p>

<p class='c022'>The major-general commanding desires to tender his thanks for

<p class='c000'>The records show, further, that Brevet Lieut.-Col.
Louis H. Carpenter was brevetted colonel for gallant
and meritorious conduct in the engagement with Indians
on Beaver Creek, Kansas, October 18, 1868. This
appointment was made on the recommendation of
General Sheridan, and was undoubtedly conferred on
this officer as being in command of the troops during
the fight. Others behaved gallantly and their conduct
deserved recognition, but this was the only brevet given
at the time.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Custer and the Famous Seventh Cavalry</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>A fighter of fighters and a soldier of soldiers
was that <em>beau sabreur</em> of the American
Army, George Armstrong Custer, “Old
Curly” to his men, “The White Chief with
the Yellow Hair,” or, more briefly, “Long Hair”
to the Indians. From Bull Run to Appomattox his
career was fairly meteoric. Second lieutenant in the
Army of the Potomac at twenty-one, fresh from West
Point, a brigadier-general at twenty-three, a major-general
at twenty-four, and commander of the third cavalry
division, which, in the six months preceding the
downfall of the Confederacy, had taken one hundred and
eleven guns, sixty-five battle-flags, and over ten thousand
prisoners of war, without losing a flag or gun, and without
a failure to capture whatever it went for—such
was his record.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard my father tell of the impression made by
the dashing young soldier whose spirited horse ran away
on Pennsylvania Avenue at the Grand Review in Washington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in spite of the efforts of his rider—a peerless
horseman—to restrain him. Custer’s hat fell off, his
long, yellow curls floated back in the wind, making a
dashing and romantic picture. He was a man of superb
physique and magnificent strength. I saw him
when I was a boy, and I have never forgotten him. His
devoted wife, in one of the three charming books in
which she has told the deathless romance of their married
life on the frontier, relates how, on one occasion,
riding by her side, with his left arm he lifted her out of
the saddle high in the air, held her there for a moment or
two, then gently replaced her on her horse. No fatigue
was too great for him to surmount, no duty, however
arduous, ever caused him to give back.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c007'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Reams have been written about his unfortunate campaign
upon the Little Big Horn, in which he went down
to such awful destruction, but little is known of some of
the exploits of his early career on the plains. After the
war, more fortunate than most of the younger general
officers who were forced to content themselves with captaincies
or less, General Custer was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel
of the new Seventh Regular Cavalry, a
regiment which was born with him, lived with him, and
a large part of which died with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officers of the regiment were a set of unusual
men. Custer himself was allowed considerable voice
in the selection of them, and such a body of officers had
been rarely assembled in one command. Most of the
troopers were not at first of the high grade to which they
afterward attained. The best men, in the ranks at
least, at the close of the Civil War, had had enough of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>fighting. They wanted to get back to civil life once
more. Not frequently it was only the inferior soldiers
who could be induced to re-enlist from the volunteer
into the regular regiments which were being organized
or reorganized.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were in the ranks, however, a leaven of veterans
who were soldiers from love as well as from habit.
With these as a nucleus, Custer and his officers, by a
judicious weeding out and a rigorous course of discipline,
soon gathered a body of troopers than which there
were none finer in the service of the United States, nor,
in fact, in any other service. Owing to the fact that the
colonel, a distinguished general officer in the war, was
on detached service commanding a department, the
regiment was practically continuously under the command
of Custer until his death in 1876.</p>

<p class='c000'>The duty that devolved upon it was the protection of
the settlers in Kansas. The job was no sinecure. In
the last half of the year 1868 statistics, which do not
pretend to be comprehensive, for they are only facts reported
officially to the headquarters of the Department of
the Missouri, show one hundred and fifty-seven people
killed, fifty-seven wounded, including forty-one scalped,
fourteen women outraged and murdered, one man, four
women and twenty-four children taken into captivity,
one thousand six hundred and twenty-seven horses,
mules and cattle stolen, twenty-four ranches or settlements
destroyed, eleven stage coaches attacked, and
four wagon trains annihilated. This with a total loss to
the Indians of eleven killed and one wounded. Truly
there was a reign of blood upon that frontier. Every
man murdered was also frightfully and disgustingly
mutilated. This record takes no account of soldiers
who were killed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>In one instance ten troopers under Lieutenant Kidder,
of the Second Cavalry, with a message for Custer’s
command, then in the field, were overtaken and slaughtered
to a man after a desperate defense. When Custer
came upon the scene of battle the bodies were so
mutilated that it was impossible to tell one from the
other. The only distinguishing mark upon any one of
them was a shirt neckband made of a material of a
peculiar marking, which was yet a common article of
wearing apparel at that time. It was by this shirt collar
that the body of Lieutenant Kidder was subsequently
identified by his mother and taken East for burial.</p>

<p class='c000'>As usual, there was strife between the Indian agents
and the army. There always has been, there always
will be. The agents invariably declared that there was
peace in the land and sought to embarrass the army in
its efforts to protect the frontier. Popular indignation,
however, at last forced the government to act, and the
campaign was long and arduous during the latter part
of the summer of 1868.</p>

<p class='c000'>The success of the soldiers was not pronounced at
first. The extent of territory was great, the force available
small, the Indians exceedingly mobile, and the
troopers had as yet scarcely learned the rules of the
game, so that it was a matter of extreme difficulty to
get at any considerable body of Indians and inflict a
crushing blow. As we have seen, General Forsyth’s command
barely escaped annihilation in the great battle
of the Arickaree. Matters dragged on, however, with
nothing decisive happening until the summer and fall
had slipped away and winter was at hand. The Indians
rarely did any fighting in the winter. It was difficult
and dangerous for horsemen to move on the exposed
prairies in the winter season, and hitherto fighting had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>been abandoned with the advent of the cold. The Indians,
during the winter, naturally tended southward,
seeking a less severe climate if it might be had, and from
November to April had been considered a closed season.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The March in the Blizzard</h4>

<p class='c020'>General Sheridan, however, who had command of the
department, determined to inaugurate a winter campaign
in the hope that the Indians, who would naturally
congregate in large villages in secluded spots sheltered
by trees along the river banks, might be rounded up and
defeated decisively. The force at his disposal for these
projected operations consisted of eleven troops of the
Seventh Cavalry, four companies of infantry, and the
Nineteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, a regiment of
settlers and old soldiers which had been organized for
the campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition was under command of Sheridan himself.
The rendezvous was at Camp Supply, in the Indian
Territory, about one hundred miles south of Fort
Dodge, Kansas. No Indians—in any considerable body,
that is—had been seen by any of the scouts sent out,
and no outrages were reported. It was evident that the
hostiles were lying snugly concealed somewhere for the
winter season. Sheridan determined to detach Custer
and his regiment from the command and send them
scouting farther southward, while with the rest of the
force, so soon as it should be in condition to march, he
himself would explore the country in other directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer received his orders on the 22d of November,
late at night. Reveillé was sounded at four o’clock on
the twenty-third. The thermometer was below zero.
There was a foot of snow upon the ground, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>still coming down furiously when Custer reported to
Sheridan that he was ready to move.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think of this?” asked Sheridan,
alluding to the weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all right,” answered Custer, cheerfully; “we
can move. The Indians can’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a hasty breakfast, coffee and hardtack,
each trooper standing by the head of his horse, and the
column moved off. The undaunted band of the regiment,
surely made up of the most heroic and hardy musicians
that ever tooted horn or thumped sheepskin, in
gallant style played them out and into the terrible blizzard
then raging, with the old marching tune “The
Girl I Left Behind Me,” which was more fancy than
truth, for there were no “girls” with that expedition,
save one hard-featured old campaigner, red-headed at
that, who went along as the commanding officer’s cook
at her own earnest request.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one can realize the force of a blizzard on the plains
who has not, as I have, experienced it. The guides almost
immediately declared themselves unable to lead
the regiment. Every cavalry officer in the field carries
a pocket compass. Custer knew where he wanted to
go. With his own compass to show the way he led the
regiment forward. The men stumbled on through the
awful snow and hurricane until two o’clock, when they
were stopped on the bank of Wolf Creek, fifteen miles
from the starting point. First caring for the exhausted
horses, they made camp, and as the wagons came up
fires were soon burning, meals were prepared, and some
of the effects of the deadly cold were dissipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, November 24th, they marched
down Wolf Creek. The snow had stopped falling, but
the temperature stood at seven degrees below zero. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>25th they continued the march. Many another commander
would have been stopped by the fearful weather;
but Custer was known as a man who would press on
as long as the mules could draw the wagons, and when
they could not he would abandon the wagons and
live off the mules. He kept on. On the twenty-sixth,
Thanksgiving Day, arriving at the north bank of the
Canadian River, he despatched Major Elliott, the second
in command of the regiment, with three troops on
a scouting expedition up the river, which he proposed
to cross with the balance of his men. There was no
Thanksgiving dinner awaiting them, and the remembrance
of the holiday spent under happier circumstances
but aggravated their present condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The river was frozen, but not sufficiently so to bear
the regiment. They had to break through the ice and
find a ford in the icy water, and it was after eleven
o’clock in the morning before the whole command succeeded
in passing to the south side. Scarcely had they
done so when they noticed a horseman galloping at full
speed toward them on the other side. As soon as he
came near they recognized him as Scout Corbin, one of
Elliott’s guides. He brought the startling news that
Elliott had come upon the trail of an Indian war party,
at least one hundred and fifty strong, and not twenty-four
hours old, which led to the south side of the river.
The scout was given a fresh horse and ordered to return
to Elliott, who was directed to follow the trail cautiously
until eight o’clock at night, at which time he was to halt
and wait for Custer, who would leave the wagon train
and follow him immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Calling the officers to him, Custer briefly gave his
orders for the advance. The wagon train was to be
left under the care of an officer and eighty men. Each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>trooper was to take one day’s rations of coffee and hardtack
and one hundred rounds of ammunition upon his
person, together with a little forage for his horse, and
the regiment was to push on at the highest possible
speed to join Elliott.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it came to designate an officer to remain with
the train, the detail fell upon Captain Louis McLane
Hamilton, whose turn it was to act as officer of the day
in camp. This young man bore two historic names.
McLane was the second in command of Light Horse
Harry Lee’s famous cavalry in the Revolution, and he
was the grandson of the great Alexander Hamilton.
He demurred bitterly to being left in the rear in command
of the train under such circumstances. There
was no help for it, however, until Custer finally informed
him that if he could get any one to take his
detail he could go.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was discovered upon inquiry that one of the officers
of the regiment had become almost helpless from snow
blindness, the glare of the ice and snow being something
terrible, especially upon an open prairie such as
they were then traversing. This officer was entirely
unfit for active campaigning, but such was his zeal to go
forward that he concealed his ailment until Hamilton’s
scrutiny brought it forth. To him, therefore, was committed
the charge of the wagon train, much against his
wish, and Hamilton was allowed to go at the head of his
troop.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The Trail in the Snow</h4>

<p class='c020'>It had grown somewhat warmer during the day.
The top crust of the snow became soft, and the horses
sank through it to their knees. There was no road or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>trail, of course, but the command advanced straight
across the open prairie toward the point where Corbin
had indicated that Elliott had picked up the trail. The
several troops were successively placed in the advance
for the fatiguing and arduous labor of breaking up the
road. There was every desire to spare the horses, but
they were nevertheless urged to the last limit to overtake
Elliott. Under such circumstances it was problematical
whether they would find him alive; for the Indians,
who were believed to be in great force, might discover
him, ambush him, attack him, and wipe him out as Fetterman
had been annihilated, or as Forsyth had been
overwhelmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the afternoon Custer and his command struck
Elliott’s trail, but it was not until nine o’clock at night
that they overtook him. They found him encamped on
the banks of a little stream and thoroughly concealed
in the timber. With relief the regiment halted, and
taking advantage of the deep ravine through which the
creek ran, they managed to build a few fires, which, being
well screened, were invisible a short distance away.
Over the fires the men made coffee, which, with the
hardtack, constituted their only meal since morning—a
Thanksgiving dinner indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Elliott had followed the trail, which was still well defined,
until eight o’clock, and then had halted in accordance
with the orders of Custer, and had waited for his
commander. A hasty council was held and some were
for taking up the advance at once. But it was pointed
out that the moon would rise in one hour and by waiting
they would have the benefit of the moonlight in following
the Indian trail. Besides, the short rest would do the
command good. Saddles were taken off, the horses
rubbed down and sparingly fed from the scanty supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of forage. At ten the march was once more resumed
in this order:</p>

<p class='c000'>First of all, riding some distance ahead of the main
body, were two Osage Indian scouts. One of these was
Little Beaver, who was chief of a small band of Indian
auxiliaries which had volunteered for the campaign.
Next to them came other Indians, several famous frontiersmen,
California Joe and Scout Corbin, and a hideous
half Negro, half Indian interpreter whose name was Romero,
but whom the soldiers facetiously dubbed Romeo,
because he was so ugly; then General Custer and his
staff, and then, some distance in rear, the successive
troops of the regiment in a column of fours. About
three miles from their camping place Little Beaver
came back to Custer in considerable agitation and declared
that he smelled fire. Nobody else smelled anything,
but at his insistence the command was halted, and
he and one of his men went forward with Custer and one
or two of the scouts until they had gone a mile from the
halting place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sure enough, after surmounting a little hill, they saw
ahead of them and some distance away the embers of a
fire. The advance party halted. Little Beaver and
the other Indians snaked their course over the ground,
taking advantage of every cover to learn what they could.
With beating hearts the general and the others watched
them. Would they stumble upon the foemen then and
there? They waited, concealed beneath the hillock, until
Little Beaver returned to tell them that the fire had
evidently been kindled by the boys guarding the herds
of ponies during the day. At any rate it had almost
gone out, no one was there, and the way was safe for
the present, although the main camp was probably not
far distant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Orders were sent back to the regiment to advance but
to keep its present distance behind Custer and the
scouts. The command proceeded with the utmost
caution, with an excitement in their veins at the stealthy
approach with its possible consequences which made
them almost insensible to the frightful cold. About
half after twelve o’clock on the morning of the twenty-seventh,
Custer saw the leading Indian suddenly sink
down behind a hill and wave his hand quickly backward.
The whole party dismounted, and the commanding
officer with one of his scouts crawled to the
hill where the Indian lay. Whispering a word or two,
Little Beaver pointed straight in front of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half a mile away a huge black blotch was tremulously
moving on the snow in the moonlight. Experienced
eyes recognized a herd of ponies. Where the
ponies were there were the Indians also. Custer
watched the scene for a moment, and upon the still air—the
wind had died and the night though bitter cold was
intensely quiet—he heard the sound of a bell, evidently
tied to the neck of the leader of the herd. Dogs barked,
and as they waited they marked the thin, shrill cry of a
little child. It was an Indian camp beyond peradventure.
Beyond it, among the bare and leafless trees,
gleamed in the moonlight the ice-bound shores of a half-frozen
river—the Washita.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general, as tender-hearted a man as ever lived,
and as kindly for all his fights, tells us how strangely
that infant’s cry heard on that bitter winter night
moved him, appealed to him. It filled his mind with
natural regret that war had to be waged and an attack
delivered upon a camp in which there were women and
children; but the stern necessities of the case permitted
no other course.</p>

    <div>SOME OFFICERS OF THE SEVENTH CAVALRY IN THE WASHITA EXPEDITION</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The band of Indians under his gaze was that of Black
Kettle,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c007'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Head Chief of the Cheyennes since the death
of Roman Nose, one of the most ferocious and brutal
of the Plains Indians. The blood of scores was upon
his hands and upon the hands of his followers as well.
Torture, infamy, treachery, shame beyond estimation,
had stained that band. Even then in the camp there
were helpless captives, poor women whose fate cannot
be described or dwelt upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Custer had satisfied himself at last that he had
found the camp for which he had been searching—which
appeared to be a very large one from the number
of lodges which they thought they could make out in the
distance—leaving the scouts to observe the Indians,
he tramped back through the snow to the command,
and by messengers summoned the officers about him.
Taking off their sabers for the moment, so that their
clanking would not betray them, the officers crept to the
crest of the hill and made themselves as familiar with
the situation as they could by such inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>There Custer gave them their final orders. The
regiment was divided into four squadrons; Major Elliott,
with three troops, G, H, and M, was ordered to circle
cautiously to the left and get in the rear of the Indian
camp. Captain Thompson, with troops B and F, was
directed to make a long detour to the right and join
Elliott. Captain Myers, with troops E and I, was commanded
to move a shorter distance to the right and take
position on the left of Thompson, while Custer himself,
with the four remaining troops—Captain Hamilton
commanding one squadron, comprising troops A and C,
Captain West, another, of troops D and K, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Osages and scouts and forty sharp-shooters under Adjutant
Cook—was to approach the village from the
point where they then stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a sound was to be made, not a shot fired, not a
signal given. The attack would be delivered at dawn.
When they heard the bugler sounding the charge in the
still air of the morning they were to rush in immediately.
In order not to impede their movements the men
were directed to remove their overcoats and leave them
in care of the guard in the rear before the attack was
delivered. Then, after hearty handshakes and whispered
salutations, the officers assembled their several
squadrons and silently started out upon the long detours
necessary to enable them to reach their designated
positions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian village was located in the valley of a small
river in the Indian Territory, an affluent of the Canadian
called the Washita. It was in a deep depression, below
the surrounding country, and was well sheltered by trees
on the banks of the stream, here easily fordable. By the
time all preparations had been made in Custer’s own
detachment it still wanted some four hours to dawn.
The troops with Custer had nothing to do but wait where
they were, and a weary, freezing wait it was. So insistent
was the general that there should be no noise
that he refused to allow the men even to beat their
breasts to keep up circulation, or to stamp their feet to
ward off the numbing cold. Conversation was forbidden.
They were dealing with a warrior who was the
most watchful of foemen, with men who could detect an
enemy, as the Osage had the fire a mile away, seemingly
by instinct. They must take every precaution. The
men dismounted and stood uncomplainingly by the side
of their horses. Some of them wrapped themselves in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>their overcoats, and attaching their bridle reins to their
wrists, lay down on the ground and actually went to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>About an hour before dawn Custer despatched the
last squadron under Captain Myers, who had but a short
distance to go, and then, as the first pale grayness of the
morning began to steal over the eastern hills and mingle
with the moonlight, he gave orders to call the troops to
attention. The first sergeants went through the ranks
and by a touch of the hand woke the sleeping men.
Stiff and numb with the cold, they staggered to their feet,
took off their overcoats, left them under the care of a
small guard, and mounted their horses. Their sabers
had been left behind and they were armed with revolvers
and Spencer carbines. The officers quickly formed
up their troops and with whispered words placed themselves
at the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The troops were deployed in line, Hamilton’s squadron
to the right, West’s to the left. Cook’s sharp-shooters
were about forty yards in advance of the left,
dismounted, their horses being left with the guard.
Some distance in front of all the rest rode Custer. Following
him was his bugler. Next to the bugler was the
indomitable regimental band. The orders were, in
Hamilton’s last words, “Now men, keep cool; fire low,
and not too rapidly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Osages had been somewhat doubtful as to the
issue of the attack. They had made medicine, war-painted
themselves and arrayed themselves for battle,
but with a great deal of trepidation. They expected
the white soldiers would be beaten, and they reasoned
that in that case their allies would endeavor to purchase
their own salvation by surrendering the Osages to the
vengeance of their enemies. They determined to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>such a position as would enable them to be governed by
circumstances in their movements—so they could either
fight or fly. They knew the reverence with which the
soldiers regarded their flag. Never having been in
action with the white man, they concluded that the flag
would be kept in a place of safety and if they stood
religiously close to the banner they would be in a good
position to attack or retreat as circumstances required.
Consequently, they rallied on the flag. For once the red
man’s reasoning led him into trouble, for, as it happened,
and as it was to be expected, the flag was in the thick of
the fight, and, to give them credit, after they saw their
mistake and saw no means of rectifying it, the Osages
fought as bravely and as efficiently as the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The command went silently down the hill, making for
the center of the valley and the trees where lay the Indian
camp. The excitement of the situation was intense.
Nobody knew just what he was about to encounter.
No one could tell whether the other troops
had succeeded in getting within supporting distance or
not. But Custer knew his officers, and he, rightly in
this instance—alas, that it might not have been so in
other cases!—depended upon them. Nearer and nearer
the line approached the village. Clearer and clearer
came the light from the pale sky. Little, hazy clouds of
smoke floated above the tepees under the trees, but aside
from that there was yet no evidence of life among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>However cautiously it was conducted the advance
of such a body of men over the snow made a great deal
of noise. They had come so near the camp that they
could not hope to remain undiscovered another moment.
At the instant Custer was about to give the signal a rifle
shot was heard on the other side of the camp. At first it
was thought to be an accidental discharge from one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the other attacking parties. It was afterward learned
that shot was fired by Black Kettle himself, who had
heard the noise of the advancing troops, for every
squadron had reached its appointed place, and practically
at the same time they commenced their advance
upon the devoted town. So soon as the crack of the
rifle broke upon the still air the bugle sounded the
charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the first notes Custer turned to the band. Each
trumpeter had his trumpet to his lips, each drummer his
drum-sticks in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Play!” he shouted, and for the first time in action
the stirring notes of the tune now peculiar to the
Seventh Cavalry as its battle music—“Garry Owen”—broke
on the air. Three answering bugle calls rang
out from the different squadrons on all sides of the
village. The cavalry charged, the dismounted soldiers
advanced on the run. They all cheered.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. The Attack in the Morning</h4>

<p class='c020'>The village was strung along the banks of the creek
and the troopers fell upon it like a storm. The Indians,
completely surprised, nevertheless did not lose a moment.
They poured out of the lodges, and seeking the
shelter of the trees or standing knee-deep in the icy
water of the river, with the banks acting as rifle-pits, returned
the fire of the white men. A few of them succeeded
in breaking away, but most of them had to fight
where they were, and right well they fought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brave Captain Hamilton, who had sought the detail
with such zeal, was shot from his horse and instantly
killed. Captain Barnitz received a wound through the
breast under his heart. Here and there others fell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Strict orders had been given to spare the women and
children. Most of the squaws and children remained
hidden in the tepees. Others took part in the defense.
The various troops scattered throughout the village and
the fighting was hand-to-hand of a most vigorous character.
Captain Benteen, galloping forward, was approached
by an Indian boy about fourteen years of age
on horseback. The boy was armed with a revolver.
As the captain drew near he called out to the lad that
his life would be safe if he would throw away his weapon.
Fearing he could not understand him he made peace
signs to him. For reply the boy leveled his weapon and
shot at the captain. The bullet missed him. The
Indian fired a second time and the bullet cut through
the sleeve of Benteen’s coat. The captain was still making
signs of amity and friendship when the boy fired a
third time and hit his horse. As he raised the pistol to
fire a fourth time the officer was forced to shoot him
dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>One squaw seized a little white boy, a captive, and
broke for the river. She got into hiding in some underbrush
where she might have remained unmolested, but
such was her malignity that she busied herself by taking
pot-shots at the galloping troops with her revolver.
They captured her when her revolver was empty and
then discovered that she had been fighting them in spite
of a broken leg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians rallied in certain places favorable for
defense. In their desperation seventeen braves threw
themselves into a little depression in the ground and refused
to surrender, fighting until all were killed. In a
ravine running from the river thirty-eight made a heroic
defense until they were all shot. In all, one hundred
and three were killed, including Black Kettle, the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The furious fighting had lasted one hour. The
village was now in possession of the troops. A number
of officers and men had been wounded and a temporary
hospital was established in the middle of the village.
Details were sent through the lodges to rout out the
squaws and children, and a roll-call was ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer was dismayed to find that Major Elliott and
fourteen men, including Sergeant-Major Kennedy and
three corporals, were missing. Where they had gone to
no one at first could imagine. Finally a trooper stated
that a number of Indians had escaped in the gap between
Elliott and Thompson, and that he had seen
Elliott with a few troopers break away in pursuit of
them. An order was given for a troop to search for
them, but before it could get away Indians were perceived
in a heavy force on the bluffs directly in front of
the command. Custer had succeeded in killing practically
the whole of Black Kettle’s band, and as the Indians
who had escaped had been forced to run for their
lives, naked as they came from the lodges, he could not
understand the appearance, just out of range of his men,
of this portentous and constantly increasing force arrayed
in full war panoply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inquiry among the captives disclosed the fact that the
valley had been chosen as the winter headquarters for
the principal bands of the Kiowas, Arapahoes, Cheyennes,
“Dog Soldiers,”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c007'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Comanches, and even a wandering
band of Apaches. There were at least two
thousand warriors in this assemblage. At that moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the men who had been guarding the overcoats and the
lead horses came running in saying that they had been
driven off by a heavy force of Indians. The situation
was indeed critical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something had to be done at once. Custer dismounted
his men, threw them out in a half circle about
the camp, and prepared for battle. The Indians did not
delay in delivering it. Led by Little Raven, an Arapahoe,
and Satanta,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c007'><sup>[50]</sup></a> a famous Kiowa, and Black Kettle’s
successor, Little Rock, they at once attacked. A fierce
battle was on and Custer’s ammunition was running low.
The troops were now fighting for their lives. They had
not expected anything of this kind. Fortunately, at this
critical juncture a four-mule wagon came dashing
through the Indian line. The Indians, being occupied
in fighting, did not observe it until it was right upon
them. Driving the wagon was Major Bell, the quartermaster,
from the train. With him was a small escort.
He had loaded the wagon with ammunition and
galloped toward the sound of the fighting. With the
fresh supplies, therefore, the troops at last made a bold
charge which drove the Indians headlong down the
valley, during which Little Rock, striving to rally his
braves, was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer now set fire to the lodges, totally destroying
them and their contents. What to do with the ponies of
the herd which had been captured in spite of the efforts
of the squaws to run off with them, was a problem. It
was impossible, under the circumstances, to drive them
back to the camp. To turn them loose would have
allowed them to fall into the hands of other Indians
for use in future warfare. They had to be shot. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>was a most unpleasant and repulsive duty for the
soldiers, but there was no alternative. The whole herd
was slaughtered. It took an hour and a half to kill
them, and those engaged in the work said they had never
done anything so harrowing and distressing.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time it was late in the afternoon. The Indians
from the other villages, finding they were pursued
but a short distance, had reassembled and once more
prepared for attack. It was necessary for Custer to
retreat at once. He put every available man on horseback,
threw out skirmishing parties, the colors were
brought up, the indefatigable band started playing, and
the party advanced gaily up the valley toward the Indians.
As he hoped and planned, they immediately
reasoned that he would not advance with such confidence
against such an overwhelming force, unless he
was supported by heavy reinforcements to his command.
After a short resistance they broke and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was night by this time, and Custer lost no time in
getting out of the valley. The weather was still frightfully
cold, and his men were without their overcoats, for
they had, of course, not recovered them, and were almost
perishing. They got back in safety, however, to Camp
Supply, having accomplished the object of their expedition
in dealing a decisive blow to the Indians.
More than that, they had shown the Indians, who trusted
for immunity to the season, that winter and summer
were alike to the American soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian loss was one hundred and three killed in
the village, including Black Kettle; an unknown number,
believed to be large, killed and wounded during the
all-day fighting, including Little Rock; the capture of
fifty-three squaws and children; eight hundred and
seventy-five ponies, eleven hundred and twenty-three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>buffalo robes and skins; the destruction of over five
hundred pounds of powder and one thousand pounds
of lead; four thousand arrows, seven hundred pounds
of tobacco, besides rifles, pistols, saddle-bows, lariats,
immense quantities of dried beef, and other winter
provisions; in short, the complete destruction of the
village and the annihilation of the band.</p>

<p class='c000'>The losses of the regiment in the engagements were
one officer and fourteen men missing (Elliott and his
party), one officer and five men killed, three officers and
eleven men wounded. General Sheridan called the
affair the most complete and satisfactory battle ever
waged against the Indians to that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer had marched through that blizzard and over
the snow-clad plains to victory. His stealthy approach,
the skill with which he had surrounded the village, the
strength with which the attack had been delivered, and
the battle which he had fought with the unexpected
Indian force, the ruse by which he had extricated himself,
and, last but not least, Bell’s gallant dash with the
ammunition wagon, were all given the highest praise.
And well they merited it.</p>

<p class='c000'>One or two incidents of the battle are worthy of especial
mention. When the troops obtained possession of
the village, they found the dead body of a white woman.
The fact that she still had some vestige of civilized
clothing upon her, quite new, proved that she had been
but recently captured. She had been shot dead by the
Indians at the moment of attack to prevent her rescue;
and there was also the body of a little white child, who
had been killed by those who had him in charge, lest he
should be returned to his family again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The squaws, of course, were in great terror. They
thought they would be instantly put to death when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>they were routed from their tepees. Black Kettle’s sister,
Mah-wis-sa, who seemed to be the leading woman
of the village, made a long oration to Custer, telling him
that she was a good Indian, and that she had tried to
restrain Black Kettle in his nefarious career—which was
all a lie, of course. She wound up by bringing the comeliest
of the young Indian maidens to Custer, and, after
solemnly placing the hand of the girl in that of the General,
mumbled some kind of a gibberish over the two.
The General observed Romeo standing near with a
broad grin upon his face, and asked him what Mah-wis-sa
was doing. He was told that she was marrying
him to the beauty of the tribe to propitiate him. That
marriage did not stand.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>V. The Fate of Elliott and his Men</h4>

<p class='c020'>The fate of Elliott’s detachment remained a mystery.
His comrades hoped that he had escaped, but as the
days passed and he did not return to the regiment, and
as nothing was heard from him, they abandoned hope
in despair. This was not, by any means, the end of the
winter campaigning; and some time after, Custer and
his men, this time heavily reinforced, again marched
up the valley of the Washita. A short distance from
the place where Black Kettle’s band had been annihilated
they found the remains of Elliott and his men.
The evidence of the field and what was afterward
learned from Indian captives told the sad story.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuing the fleeing Indians, Elliott and his party
suddenly ran into the midst of a horde of braves coming
down the valley to help Black Kettle and the men who
had been engaged with Custer. To fly was impossible.
They dismounted from their horses, formed themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in a semicircle a few feet in diameter, stood back to
back, as it were, and fought until they died. There were
evidences of a terrible conflict all around them. Right
dearly had they sold their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last survivor of that gallant little band had been
Sergeant-Major Kennedy, the finest soldier in the regiment.
He was not wounded, it appeared, but had expended
all his ammunition for both rifle and revolver.
Being an officer, he wore a sword. Seeing him, as they
supposed, helpless, the Indians resolved to take him
alive for the purpose of torturing him. There was
not a soldier who knew of the habits of the Indians who
would not chose death to captivity any time. The
brave Kennedy stood alone in the midst of the bodies
of his comrades, fronting death, sword in hand. I like
to think of the courage of that heroic man in the midst
of that savage, ravening assemblage.</p>

<p class='c000'>With wily treachery the Indians made peace signs,
and walked toward him with hands outstretched,
saying: “How, How!” Kennedy, who knew the true
value of such proceedings, waited until the chief of the
band approached him nearly, then thrust his sword up
to the hilt into the Indian’s breast. When they found
Kennedy’s body he had been pierced by no less than
twenty bullets. The other troopers had received one
or two bullet wounds each. They were all stripped,
scalped, and mutilated.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c007'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There was a great outcry when this battle became
known, and Custer was accused of slaughtering helpless,
inoffensive, gentle Indians! Unmerited obloquy was
heaped upon him, but those who lived near enough to
feel the effects of the Red Scourge realized that he had
done for the settlers the best thing that could be done.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>People who knew, and his superior officers, not only
sustained but commended him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer again, in command of a much larger force,
surprised a more populous village later in this same winter.
It was completely in his power. He could have
wiped it from the face of the earth, although it contained
a force of Indians nearly equal to his own; but he stayed
his hand, and said he would spare the savages if they
would deliver to him two wretched women, one a young
bride, the other a young girl, whom they held in captivity
and for whose deliverance the campaign had been
undertaken. By masterly skill Custer captured Satanta
the Infamous, and held him until the captives were given
up. With the expedition was the brother of one of the
captives. Custer tells, in his simple, terse manner, with
what feelings that whole army watched the poor women
brought into camp, and how the boy, the last of his
family, stood trembling by the general’s side until he
recognized, in one of the wrecks of humanity which the
Indians handed over, the sister whom he was seeking.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c007'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The red-headed cook, referred to above, was with the
army again, and proved herself, in her rude way, an
angel of mercy and tenderness to these, her wretched
sisters.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER ELEVEN<br /> <span class='large'>Carr and Tall Bull at Summit Springs</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. A Brilliant Little Fight</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>General Eugene A. Carr, in command of
the Fifth Cavalry, did some brilliant skirmishing
and fighting in 1868–9 western Kansas
and Colorado. His most notable exploit was
the surprise of Tall Bull’s camp. Next to Black
Kettle, Tall Bull was probably the most vicious and
diabolical of the Indian raiders in these two states.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carr, with five troops of the Fifth Cavalry and with
W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) as chief guide, learning where
Tall Bull’s camp was, marched one hundred and fifty
miles in four days in pursuit of him. Halting when he
believed he had reached the vicinity of the camp, he sent
Buffalo Bill with some of his Pawnee Indian auxiliaries
to find out exactly where the Indians were located.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cody, having discovered the location of the village, returned
to General Carr and advised him to take a wider
detour, keeping his forces concealed among the hills,
so that he could approach the Indians from the north,
a direction from which they would not be expecting
attack, and whence they might be the more easily surprised.
The advice was followed, the command made
its encircling march without detection, and formed up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>in line of troops, each troop two abreast, in the ravines
about twelve hundred yards from the village.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were between the Indians and the Platte River.
The camp was located at Summit Springs, Colorado.
Every preparation having been made, Carr ordered the
bugler to sound the charge. The man was so excited
that he was unable to produce a note. Twice Carr gave
the command. Finally, Quartermaster Hayes snatched
the bugle from the agitated musician and sounded the
charge himself, and the whole regiment rushed out into
the open.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians made for their ponies and advanced to
meet the charge. The rush of the soldiers was too
threatening, however. After a hasty fire they broke and
fled on their horses, the whole party, soldiers and Indian
scouts, following after at full speed through the village.
The attack was a complete success. Fifty-two Indians
were killed, two hundred and seventy-four horses and
one hundred and forty-five mules were captured. The
soldiers had one man wounded, with no other casualties.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the camp were found the bodies of two unfortunate
white women, who had been captured. Swift as had
been the dash of the soldiers, the Indians had taken time
to brain one of the women with a war-club, while the
second was shot in the breast and left for dead. She
was given every possible attention by the soldiers, who
took her back to Fort Sedgwick, and her life was eventually
spared. Her sufferings and treatment had been
beyond description. Fifteen hundred dollars in money—in
gold, silver, and greenbacks—strange to say, had
been found in the camp. This sum the soldiers, by permission
of the general, donated to the poor woman,
as an expression of their sympathy for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to some accounts, Tall Bull, who was chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of the camp, and one of the head chiefs of the Sioux,
was killed in this attack. Buffalo Bill tells another story.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c007'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
The day after the fight the various companies of the
Fifth Cavalry—which had remained in the camp all the
ensuing day and night, at the insistence of the plucky
commander, in spite of the pleas of some of the officers,
who, fearing an attack in force, suggested retiring immediately—separated
in order the more effectively to pursue
the flying Indians. Several days after the surprise
the detachment for which Cody was guide was attacked
by several hundred Indians. The soldiers fought
them off, killing a number. The chief of this party
was believed by Cody to be Tall Bull.</p>

<p class='c000'>Buffalo Bill crept through a ravine for several hundred
feet, unobserved by the Indians, until he reached an
opening whence he had the savages in range. Watching
his opportunity as the Indians were careering wildly
over the prairie, he drew a bead on the chief and shot
him dead. Whether that was Tall Bull or not, one fact
is clear—that he was killed either then or before, for he
was certainly dead thereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the troops were following the Indian trails on
the march to Summit Springs, at every place where the
Indians had camped they found marks of white women’s
shoes. It was this knowledge that gave additional
determination and fire to their magnificent attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Carr deservedly gained great reputation for
his dash and daring.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>Here I include a letter describing this battle from the
standpoint of a soldier, which is a most interesting contribution
to the story of the affair:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>II. Account of the Battle of Summit Springs</h4>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>Written by J. E. Welch to his comrade, Colonel Henry O. Clark, of</div>
    <div>Vermont.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c007'><sup>[54]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The next spring, 1869, I heard that General Eugene
A. Carr, commanding a detachment of the Fifth U. S.
Cavalry, was organizing an expedition to go after a large
band of Indians (Sioux and Cheyennes) who had been
raiding and murdering through Colorado, New Mexico,
and Kansas. Some other fellows and myself went
to Fort McPherson and offered our services as volunteers
to serve without pay. The general could not accept
our services, but he said we could go along and act
with the scouts—so along we went.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition consisted of about four hundred cavalry,
one hundred and fifty Pawnee scouts, under Colonel
Frank North, and about twenty civilians. Buffalo
Bill was the guide. He struck out for the Republican
River, and the first night after we got there the hostiles
tried to stampede our horses; they came near accomplishing
their object, too, but they only succeeded in
wounding a teamster and killing a mule. Next day we
found the trail of their main body and followed it, but
soon found that we could not gain an inch on them; we
kept on, however, until we came to a place where the
trail divided. The trail to the right was very plain,
while the one to the left was scattered and so dim it was
evident to the most inexperienced man in the command
that the trail they intended us to follow was the one to
the right. So General Carr detached two troops of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>cavalry and some Indians, under Major Royall, caused
them to make as big a show as possible and take the decoy
trail, while the main body was kept back in a low
place for a day in order that any hostile scouts who
might be watching us would think the whole command
had gone on the decoy trail. Next day we started on
the dim trail, and before night we became satisfied that
we were on the trail of the main body of the hostiles.
Major Royall followed the decoy trail until it scattered,
then turning the head of his column to the left he intercepted
and rejoined the command. We now found
that we were gaining on the game we were after. They
evidently thought they had fooled us, and were taking
their time.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the tenth of July we marched sixty-five miles,
passing three of their camps. On the eleventh we were
on the march before daylight. The trail was hot, the
Indians making for the Platte. Every one knew that if
they succeeded in crossing the river the game was up.
By noon we had marched thirty-five miles, at which
time Buffalo Bill, who had been far in advance of the
command all day, was seen approaching as fast as his
tired horse could come. As soon as he reached the
column he called for a fresh horse, and while transferring
his saddle told General Carr that he had encountered
two bucks who were hunting and that the
Indian camp was about twelve miles ahead.</p>

    <div>GROUP OF DISTINGUISHED GENERAL OFFICERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The general, knowing the bucks who had been run off
by Cody would make every effort to reach their camp
ahead of us in order to give the alarm, gave the command
“Trot.” Both horses and men seemed to brighten
up, and we put real estate behind us at a rapid rate.
When within a mile of the hostile camp a halt was called
to let the Pawnees unsaddle, as they flatly refused to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>into action with saddles on their horses. They began
daubing their faces with paint and throwing off their
clothing. They were made to retain enough of the latter
to enable us to distinguish them from the hostiles. After
this short delay we moved forward at a sharp trot,
and in a few moments we were looking down at “Tall
Bull’s” camp in a small valley below us. In a moment
the camp was alive with Indians running in every direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Carr, taking in the situation at a glance,
gave utterance to a few words of command, winding up
his remarks with the order, given loud and clear and
sharp:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Charge!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Every horse leaped forward at the word, and in a
twinkling we were among them and the fight was on.
It did not last long. There was rapid firing for about
five minutes, when all was over except an occasional
shot as some fellow would find an Indian who had failed
to secure a horse and escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of the fight was about as following: no
white men killed, four or five horses killed, about one
hundred and eighty-eight dead Indians, forty of whom
were squaws and children;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c007'><sup>[55]</sup></a> one hundred and five lodges
captured, many rifles, five tons of dried buffalo meat
baled for winter use, a very ample supply of ammunition,
consisting of powder, lead, etc., and a greater number
and variety of brass kettles than I ever saw before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of their live stock we captured five hundred and sixty
head of ponies and mules.</p>

<p class='c000'>To pursue those who had fled was out of the question,
our horses being too badly done up. As we charged
the camp, we saw a white woman run from among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Indians, one of whom fired at her as she ran. We
shouted to her to lie down, which she did, our horses
leaping over her without a hoof touching her. She
was wounded in her side, but not fatally. Almost at the
same moment we saw an Indian seize another white
woman by the hair and brain her with a tomahawk.
Some of us rode straight for that Indian, and there was
not a bone left in his dead carcass that was not broken
by a bullet. I dismounted in the midst of the hubbub
to see if I could help the woman, but the poor creature
was dead. (She had the appearance of being far gone
in pregnancy.) I mounted my horse again with a very
good stomach for a fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>After firing a few shots, I happened to see a Red
mounted on a large paint pony making off by himself,
and driving four fine mules ahead of him. I gave chase
and gained on him rapidly, which he soon perceived,
dropping his mules and doing the best he could to get
away. But it was no use. “Sam,” my horse, was Kentucky
bred, and walked right up on him. When I was
within seventy-five or one hundred yards of him he
wheeled his horse and fired, the bullet passing through
the calf of my leg and into my horse. The Indian threw
his gun away and rode at me like a man, discharging
arrows as he came. The third arrow split my left ear
right up to my head. It was then my turn, and I shot
him through the head. This Indian’s name was
“Pretty Bear.” He was chief of a band of Cheyennes.
The Pawnees knew him and were anxious to secure his
scalp, which I was glad to give them as I soon became
disgusted with the ghastly trophy. “Pretty Bear” had
on his person the badge of a Royal Arch Mason, with
West Springfield, Ill., engraved on it. I sent the badge
to the postmaster at Springfield with a statement as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>how it came into my possession. “Pretty Bear” had
five or six scalps on the trail of his shield, one of
which was that of a woman. The hair was brown,
very long, and silken.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tall Bull,” the Sioux chief, was killed by Lieutenant
Mason, who rode up to him and shot him through
the heart with a derringer. After I had taken the scalp
of “Pretty Bear” I found that Sam was shot through the
bowels. I unsaddled him and turned him loose to die,
but he followed me like a dog and would put his head
against me and push, groaning like a person. I was
forced to shoot him to end his misery. I had to try two
or three times before I could do it. At first to save
my life I could not do it. He kept looking at me with
his great brown eyes. When I did fire he never knew
what hurt him. He was a splendid horse, and could
do his mile in 1.57.</p>

<p class='c000'>My wounds being slight, I rustled around and soon
managed to catch a small mule, which I mounted bareback,
intending to scout around a little. I did not carry
out my intention, however. The brevet horse ran into
the middle of the Indian camp, threw me into a big
black mud-hole, my boot was full of blood, my ear had
bled all over one side of me, so that when I crawled out
of that mud-hole I was just too sweet for anything. By
this time the fight was over. A friend of mine, Bill
Steele, went with me to the spring that ran into the mud-hole,
where he washed me as well as he could, bandaged
my leg, sewed my ear together with an awl and some
linen thread. He made a good job of it, and I was all
right except that my leg was a little sore and stiff.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the fight we found we had one hundred and
seventeen prisoners, four squaws, and fifteen children.
They were turned over to the Pawnees. The Pawnees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>did not fight well. They skulked and killed the women
and children. I have never seen Indians face the music
like white men. We camped where we were that night.
Men were coming into camp all night. In fact, they did
not reach the scene of action until about ten o’clock next
day. They were fellows who had been left along the
trail by reason of their horses giving out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our first duty next day was to bury the poor woman
they had so foully murdered the day before. Not having
a coffin, we wrapped her in a buffalo robe. General
Carr read the funeral service and the cavalry sounded
the funeral dirge, and as the soft, mournful notes died
away many a cheek was wet that had long been a stranger
to tears. The other woman was found to be all
right with the exception of a wound in the side. She
was a German, unable to speak English. Both of the
women had been beaten and outraged in every conceivable
manner. Their condition was pitiful beyond any
power of mine to portray.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian camp and everything pertaining thereto
was destroyed, after which we took up our line of march
for Fort Sedgwick, where we arrived in due time without
any mishap.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think it just as impossible to make a civilized man
of the Indian as it would be to make a shepherd dog of
a wolf, or a manly man of a dude. They do not in my
opinion possess a single trait that elevates a man above
a brute. They are treacherous, cowardly, and ungrateful,
Cooper to the contrary notwithstanding. I knew a
Greek in Arizona who came to the country with camels
for the government. After the camels died he married
an Apache squaw, learned the language, and was employed
by the United States government as an interpreter.
This man told me that in the Apache dialect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>there was no word, or combination of words, whereby
they could convey the idea that we do by using the
word <em>Gratitude</em>. What do you think of that?</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, old man, I have been writing half the night,
and have only got as far as the 11th of July ’69. I am
discouraged, and right here I quit you like a steer in the
road. How long am I to wait for that picture? I am
curious to see how much of a change old dad Time has
wrought in you. He has played h—l with me.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. The Cause of the Fighting</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Late in 1876 the government determined
that thereafter all Indians in the Northwest
must live on the reservations. For a long
time the Interior Department, to which the
management of Indian affairs was committed, had
been trying in vain by peaceable means to induce
them to do this. The Indians were at last definitely
informed that if they did not come into the reservation
by the first of January, 1876, and stay there, the task
of compelling them to do so would be turned over to
the War Department. They did not come in; on the
contrary, many of those on the reservations left them
for the field; and thus the war began.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal adviser and most influential head man
among the Sioux Nation and its allied tribe, the Cheyennes,
was Sitting Bull,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c007'><sup>[56]</sup></a> an Unkpapa chief and a
great medicine man. He does not seem to have been
much of a fighter. The Indians said he had a big head
but a little heart, and they esteemed him something of
a coward; in spite of this, his influence over the chiefs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and the Indians was paramount, and remained so
until his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps he lacked the physical courage which is
necessary in fighting, but he must have had abundant
moral courage, for he was the most implacable enemy
and the most dangerous—because of his ability,
which was so great as to overcome the Indians’ contempt
for his lack of personal courage—that the
United States had ever had among the Indians. He
was a strategist, a tactician—everything but a fighter.
However, his lack of fighting qualities was not serious,
for he gathered around him a dauntless array of war
chiefs, the first among them being Crazy Horse, an
Oglala, a skilful and indomitable, as well as a brave
and ferocious, leader.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sioux country was encircled by forts and agencies.
The Missouri River inclosed it on the east and
north. On the south were the military posts along the
line of the Union Pacific Railroad. To the west were
the mountains. Sitting Bull and his followers took
position in the valleys of the Big Horn near the sources
of the Powder River, right at the center of the encircling
forts and agencies. It was a situation whence
they could move directly upon the enemy in any direction
as necessity required.</p>

<p class='c000'>For years unscrupulous and mercenary traders had
supplied the savages with high-grade firearms in spite
of government protests. The Indians were better
armed than the soldiers, and possessed ammunition in
plenty. Their numbers in the field have been estimated
at from twelve hundred to six thousand warriors,
with their wives and children. Those who have
studied the war from the Indian point of view have put
the number at the lower figure; nearly every one else at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>from three thousand up. Whatever the facts, there were
enough of them to give the United States Army the
busiest time that it had enjoyed since the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three expeditions were planned for the winter,
which were to be launched upon the Indians simultaneously.
One, under General Gibbon, was to come
eastward from western Montana; another, under General
Crook, was to advance northward from southern
Nebraska; and the third, under Custer, was to strike
westward from Fort Lincoln. It was believed that
any one of the three, each of which comprised more
than a thousand men, would be strong enough to defeat
the Indians, the only problem being to catch
them or corner them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The well-known disinclination of Indians to fight
pitched battles is a factor which enters largely into
every campaign. Somehow or other, the Indians in this
campaign did not seem to be so disinclined that way.
One cannot but admire the skill with which they
manœuvered and the courage with which they fought.
Putting aside all questions of their cruelty and brutality—and
what else could be expected from them?—they
were patriots fighting for the possession of their native
land. Bravely they fought, and well. They were fully
apprised of the movements of the troops, and resolved
to attack them in severalty and beat them in detail.
We shall see how completely they did so, and with
what brilliant success they battled, until they were
run down, worn out, scattered, killed, or captured.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. Reynolds’ Abortive Attempt</h4>

<p class='c020'>The weather was something frightful. Indeed, all
through the ensuing spring it was unprecedentedly inclement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Neither Custer’s expedition nor Gibbon’s
got away in winter. Crook did advance, and first
came in touch with the enemy with results not altogether
satisfactory. General Joseph J. Reynolds, with
ten troops from the Second and Third Cavalry, surprised
and took possession of Crazy Horse’s village,
on the Powder River, on the morning of March 17,
1876. The troops had partially destroyed the village
while under a severe fire from the Indians who had
rallied on bluffs and hills round about it, when Reynolds
abandoned the position and retreated. He was,
of course, pursued by the Indians, grown bolder than
before, if possible, as they saw the reluctant soldiers
giving up their hard-won prize.</p>

<p class='c000'>So precipitate was Reynolds’ withdrawal, in fact,
that the bodies of several troopers who had been shot
in the action were abandoned to the malignity of the
savages, and there was a persistent whisper, which will
not down, to the effect that one wounded man was also
left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to this, an army officer of high rank personally
stated to me that Reynolds was in such a state of excitement,
as the afternoon wore away and Crook did
not join him in the village, that he finally peremptorily
ordered the troops to mount and go away, in spite
of the fact that the work of destruction was not complete.
This was bad enough, but my informant solemnly
asserted that Reynolds, in spite of plea and
even remonstrance, compelled him to leave behind a
wounded trooper, who must necessarily have been
tortured by the Indians so soon as they reoccupied
the village. Captain Bourke has gone on record in
his “On the Border with Crook,” expressing his belief in
the truth of this charge, which forever stains the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of the commander of the expedition. The whole affair
was a disgrace to the army, and many of the officers
of the command, capable and brave men, felt it
keenly. They chafed for a chance to show their
qualities, which they had later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cold was intense, the temperature dropping to
thirty degrees below zero. The soldiers suffered
greatly in the retreat. The Indians, who seemed impervious
to cold, pursued them and succeeded in recapturing
their pony herd of some seven hundred
head, which Reynolds was endeavoring to bring
away with him. Crook, bringing up the infantry and
wagons, was furious when he met the retreating cavalry
and heard its story.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were a number of courts-martial subsequently,
but little came of them, and the matter was finally
allowed to drop upon the retirement or resignation of
some of the officers chiefly concerned. It was a disgraceful
affair, and all the honors rested with Crazy
Horse. The Indians were greatly encouraged. The
loss of the troops was four men killed and six wounded,
and sixty-six men badly frozen or otherwise incapacitated
by the cold.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The March to the Tongue River</h4>

<p class='c020'>After the ignominious outcome of Reynolds’ attack
upon the village of Crazy Horse, the various expeditions
noted spent the greater part of the spring in preparing
for the grand advance of the converging columns which
were to inclose the recalcitrant Indians in a cordon
of soldiers, force them back on the reservations, and
thus, it was sincerely hoped, end the war. It will be
necessary to follow the movements of the several columns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>separately. As that of Crook first came in contact
with the Indians, its history will be first discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reorganized command for the campaign, which
assembled at Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, included fifteen
troops of cavalry—about nine hundred men—ten
of the Third, under command of Colonel Evans, and
five of the Second, under Major Noyes, the whole being
under the command of Colonel William B. Royall, of
the Third.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c007'><sup>[57]</sup></a> There were also three companies of the
Ninth Infantry and two of the Fourth, a total of three
hundred men, under the command of Colonel Chambers.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an abundance of transportation, a long
wagon train, and an invaluable pack train. The troops
were generously provided with everything necessary for
the hard work before them. It was the largest, and it
was believed to be the most efficient, force which had
ever been sent against the Indians in the West.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook, an officer of large experience, especially in Indian
fighting, assumed personal command of the expedition
on the 28th of May, 1876. On the 29th the
march began. The objects of the campaign were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>villages of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, which were
believed to be somewhere on the Rosebud River. The
topography of that country is well known now, but then
it was more or less of a terra incognita—rather more
than less, by the way. Certainly, this was true after the
Tongue River was reached. The advance was made
at first up the Bozeman trail, past Fort Reno, and over
the battle-fields around the ruins of abandoned and destroyed
Fort Phil Kearney, which were objects of much
interest to the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th of June the army encamped on the south
side of the Tongue River, near the point where that
stream intersects the Montana boundary line. Crazy
Horse<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c007'><sup>[58]</sup></a> had been fully advised by disaffected Indians at
the agencies and military posts, as well as by his own
daring scouts, of all these preparations that were being
made to overwhelm him. He had sent to Crook a
specific warning not to cross the Tongue River, and
declared his intent to attack him immediately he
reached that stream. To prove that his threat
was no idle boast, he mustered his warriors, and at
half after six o’clock on the evening of the 9th, from
the high bluffs on the other side, opened fire upon
the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through a fortunate mistake the Indians directed
their fire to the tents of the camp, imagining that they
would be full of men. They happened to be empty.
The Sioux soon got the range, and the camp was
swept with bullets. They ripped open mess chests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>shattered the sides of the wagons, destroyed the baggage,
killed a few horses, but did little damage to
the men.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c007'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Third Cavalry was divided into three battalions,
one of four, and two of three troops each.
Captain Mills commanded the first battalion, Captain
Henry the second, Captain Van Vliet the third.
Crook acted promptly. He sent forward three companies
of his infantry, deploying them as skirmishers,
to line the river bank and open fire on the Indians
in plain view on the bluff on the other side. At
the same time he ordered Captain Mills to take his
battalion across the river and charge the enemy. The
Sioux were already unsettled by the accurate fire of
the infantry with their long-range rifles, and as Mills’
battalion deployed, dashed through the water and at
the steep bluffs on the other side, they broke and fled,
having suffered little or no loss, and not having inflicted
much more.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. The Flying Column</h4>

<p class='c020'>The skirmish was simply a grim earnest of the determined
purpose of the Indian chief. No pursuit was
attempted at that time. Negotiations had been entered
into between the Crows, who were the hereditary enemies
of the Sioux, and the Shoshones, with a view to securing
a body of Indian auxiliaries to the troops, whose
services would be invaluable for scouting. Persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>thereto by Frank Gruard,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c007'><sup>[60]</sup></a> a celebrated scout, something
less than two hundred Crows, with eighty odd
Shoshones, joined the army on the 15th of June.</p>

<p class='c000'>To pursue Indians while incumbered with infantry
and a wagon train was well nigh a hopeless task. Crook
determined to park the wagons and baggage, leave
them under the command of Major Furey, the quartermaster,
strip his command to the lightest marching order,
and make a dash for the Rosebud River and the
Indian country. One hundred infantrymen, protesting
most vehemently against their orders, to their credit,
be it said, were detailed to remain with the train. Two
hundred others, who professed to have some skill in
riding, were mounted on the mules of the wagon train
to accompany the cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning of the 15th was spent in accustoming
the infantrymen to the mules and the mules to the infantrymen.
The cavalrymen and the Indian allies enjoyed
the circus which ensued when the mules were bridled
and saddled for the first time, and mounted by men
who had never before straddled anything more formidable
than a fence rail. It took the whole morning
before the infantrymen and the mules learned to get
along with each other, even in a half-hearted way.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>At five <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, on the 16th, the force, numbering a
little less than eleven hundred men, with two hundred
and fifty Indian auxiliaries, crossed the Tongue River
and marched to the Rosebud.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c007'><sup>[61]</sup></a> They bivouacked that
night on the banks of the Rosebud, on a level depression
surrounded by low bluffs on all sides, forming a
sort of natural amphitheater, on the top of which the
pickets were stationed. Each man carried four days’
rations of hardtack, coffee, and bacon in his saddle-bags
and one hundred rounds of ammunition upon his
person. The pack train was limited to two mules carrying
the medical supplies. There being little to do at
the wagon camp on Goose Creek, a number of mule
packers, led by a veteran, Tom Moore, accompanied
the expedition to help the foot soldiers to manage their
mules, and incidentally to take part in the fighting.
There were no tents, of course, and but one blanket (a
single blanket at that) for each man. This blanket
barely kept off the heavy dew, and the night was a
thoroughly uncomfortable one.</p>

<p class='c000'>At three <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 17th of June reveillé was sounded.
After breakfast and the care of the horses and
mules, six o’clock found the troops on the march down
the Rosebud. At eight o’clock they halted and unsaddled
their animals to give them a nibble of grass and
a little rest, preparatory to a farther advance later on,
while the Crows and Shoshones were sent on ahead to
scout. The place in which they had stopped was an
amphitheater, like their camp ground of the night before,
a rolling bit of boggy prairie, inclosed on all sides
by bluffs, every point being within rifle shot of the center.
Through this amphitheater ran the Rosebud
River, here a mere creek, its general direction being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>from west to east. Toward the east side of the amphitheater
the creek was diverted to the left, the northeastward,
and plunged into a gloomy and forbidding
cañon, called the Dead Cañon of the Rosebud. The
course of the river was marked by a rank undergrowth
of grass, small trees, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills’ battalion of the Third Cavalry halted on the
south bank of the creek. In rear of Mills was Noyes’
battalion of the Second Cavalry. Across the creek were
Henry’s and Van Vliet’s battalions of the Third Cavalry,
the mounted infantrymen, and the small pack train with
the packers. Crook desired to keep his movements
secret, but it had been impossible to restrain the impetuosity
of the Indian auxiliaries the day before. They
had come across a herd of buffalo and had made great
slaughter of the helpless animals, killing one hundred
and fifty of them, for which they had no use at all. It
is certain that so able a general as Crazy Horse had
scouts watching Crook all the time, and would have discovered
his advance in any event; but with all the noise
made by the Indians in the buffalo hunt, there was no
possibility of a surprise. As a matter of fact, it was
Crazy Horse who began the game. Crook was ready
for him.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>V. The Battle of the Rosebud</h4>

<p class='c020'>About half after eight o’clock in the morning, the
resting soldiers were called to attention by the sound of
shots from the bluffs in front of them, over which their
allies had disappeared. It was at first supposed that
these friendly Indians had run across another herd of
buffalo, but a few moments told the practised troopers
that the firing was the beginning of a battle rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that of a hunt. At the same time the Indian auxiliaries
came galloping back to the main body at full speed,
yelling:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sioux, Sioux! Heap Sioux!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without waiting for orders, the troopers saddled their
horses and fell in. They got ready none too soon, for
right on the heels of the fleeing Crows and Shoshones
came the Sioux. In front of them to the right, the left,
the low bluffs inclosing the plain, were ringed with Indians
in full war-gear. As one observer described it to
me, they looked like swarms of blackbirds, there were
so many of them and in such rapid motion. They kept
coming and coming into view, and as they dashed up to
the brink of the hills upon their war ponies they opened a
long-range fire upon the soldiers, which from the distance
did little damage. There were at least a thousand of
them in plain sight. How many others there might be,
no one could tell. It was a safe guess that those in
sight constituted but a small part of the force.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that there were at least six thousand warriors
that day under the command of Crazy Horse, but
that most of them were not engaged. Crazy Horse had
planned an ambush for General Crook, and he had
hoped to defeat him by luring the soldiers into it, or by
separating the army into small detachments and overwhelming
them in detail. His plans were well devised,
and came very near being successful. That they did
not succeed is probably due more to the acts of the
Indians themselves than because of the wariness of the
soldiers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Crook acted at once. Sending his staff officers to
rally the Crows and Shoshones, he directed them to circle
to the right and left, and make ready to fall on the
flanks of the Indians. Mills, who had behaved so gallantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>at the Tongue River, was ordered to charge the
Indians straight up the valley to the bluff to the northward,
the front. Two troops of Van Vliet’s squadron
were rushed off to the southward, the rear, to seize a
commanding position to prevent the Indians from circling
around in that direction and getting in Crook’s
rear. The infantry and part of the Second Cavalry were
dismounted, and thrown forward as skirmishers around
the foot of the bluffs. Royall took Henry’s battalion,
with Van Vliet’s remaining troop, one of Mills’ troops
which he detached while the battalion was on the
gallop, and another of Noyes’ troops, and charged the
Indians on the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills’ charge was most gallantly delivered. The soldiers
struggled through the bog, raced across the bottom
land for about eight hundred yards, and scrambled
up the bluffs in twenty minutes, finding themselves,
when they reached the top, within fifty paces of the
Sioux. There was no time to use carbines. Firing
revolvers, the battalion rushed at the Indians. The
savages fired ineffectively, gave way, and fled instantly
to higher ground six hundred yards further on, where
they opened fire. In their excitement they shot badly.
Mills dismounted his battalion, deployed them as skirmishers,
rushed the second ridge and cleared it, the
Indians sullenly retiring before him, and again opened
fire on the troops, to which the cavalrymen made effective
reply. The Sioux galloped rapidly to and fro, yelling
and firing from their horses, kicking up clouds of
dust, but doing little harm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Royall, Henry, and Van Vliet had a similar success on
the left, where the ground was much more open and unfavorable
for defense, although the Indians were massed
more heavily in that quarter than before Mills.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Meanwhile the Crows and Shoshones had fallen upon
the flanks of the Sioux, but not very effectively. Every
one in the field except a small reserve was now hotly engaged.
The pressure on Mills became stronger, but he
drove the Indians from him by another gallant attack.
Thereafter he was reinforced by Noyes’ battalion. The
front of his line was finally partially cleared by this last
dash. The Indians who had been attacking him thereupon
left him, and joined the others before Royall and
Henry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook now withdrew Mills’ command from the battlefield,
and Mills was ordered to take his three troops
down the Dead Cañon of the Rosebud and attack the
villages which it was believed the Indians were defending.
Mills’ movements were supported by the five troops
of the Second Cavalry under Noyes. Crook promised
to follow up the movement, and support it with the remaining
cavalry and infantry. We will follow this
movement later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills’ place in the line was occupied by Tom Moore
and his packers and some other auxiliaries from the
camp, and a smart fire was kept up in that direction. On
the left the firing was fast and furious. The Indians from
the front cleared by Mills joined their associates on the
left, and again and again attacked Royall, Henry, and
Van Vliet, who had joined the other two, with the
most determined courage. Charge and counter charge
were made over that portion of the field. Now the
troops gave way before the Indian advance, now the
soldiers were rallied and hurled back the Indians, now
the Indians retreated before some desperate countercharge.
So went the varying fortunes of the hour.
The number of savages increased with every passing
moment. To the eyes of the astonished soldiers they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>seemed to spring from the ground. If one fell in the
line, a dozen were ready to take his place.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_253.jpg' alt='BATTLE OF THE ROSEBUD' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In one of the charges Captain Henry was shot through
the face and frightfully wounded. The troopers had
dismounted, but the officers remained mounted. Henry
reeled in his saddle as the bullet pierced both his cheek
bones and tore out the whole front of his face below the
eyes. Although, as an eye-witness has it, he was spitting
blood by the handful, he continued on the battle
line. The situation of Royall’s wing of Crook’s army
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>was precarious. Henry’s battalion held the extreme
left flank. It was his duty to remain there. Vroom’s
troop L, of the Third Cavalry, had become separated from
the main body during the battle, and was caught ahead
of the line and surrounded by Indians, in imminent
danger of annihilation. Crook had ordered Royall
to bring his men back to their horses, in order to mount
them and prepare for a general charge. The Indians
took this movement for a retreat, and came dashing
after the retrograding troopers. Only the cool courage
of Royall and Henry, and the magnificent way in which
they handled their forces when they went forward to the
rescue, prevented the annihilation of Vroom’s troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the midst of this operation that Henry received
his fearful wound and stayed on the line.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c007'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Presently
he fell from his horse. As he did so, the soldiers,
dismayed by his fall, began to give back before
the Sioux. The impetuous Indians charged over the
place where Henry lay. Fortunately, he was not struck
by the hoofs of the galloping horses. His men rallied
and rushed to his rescue. Old Chief Washakie and his
Shoshones at this period of the fighting displayed splendid
courage. The fight actually raged over the body of
Captain Henry until the Indians were driven off, and
Henry was rescued from what would otherwise have
been certain death. After this fierce struggle, part
breaking through the line and part turning the flank,
the Indians galloped down the valley between the river
and the troops, and finally disappeared on the other side
of the Dead Cañon, their retreat accelerated by the
movement of Mills toward the village. The fighting
had lasted a little more than two hours.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>VI. Mills’ Advance down the Cañon</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Meanwhile Mills and his men, in a column of twos,
trotted down the gloomy depths of the Dead Cañon, the
rocky walls of which, towering on either side, would have
afforded abundant cover for Indian riflemen. Before
entering the cañon, they had cleared the mouth of it of
a body of Sioux by a smart charge, and they were thereafter
unmolested. They advanced rapidly but with caution,
although what they could have done if attacked it is
hard to see, and how caution would have saved them it
is difficult to tell. They had their orders to go through
the cañon and attack the village. There was nothing to
do but obey. Sending them forward was a mistake
which might have resulted in a terrible disaster, although
nobody believed that then. The soldiers had
not yet realized what fighters these Indians were. The
Custer disaster was still to come, and no one imagined
that so large a body as that commanded by Mills and
Noyes could be defeated. If Crook had followed with
his whole force, the troops under his command would
have been annihilated; it is probable that not one of
them would have come out of that cañon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Crook began to prepare to follow Mills with
the rest of his force, he discovered that he had a much
larger number of wounded than he had thought possible,
and the doctors protested against their being left with a
feeble guard while Crook with the best of the force went
up the cañon. The protest was justified by the situation.
Besides, the attack on Royall and Henry had not
yet ceased. Crook reflected, concluded that he could not
leave the field, and that Mills’ force was too weak for the
work assigned it. The general thereupon despatched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Captain Nickerson, of his staff, attended by a single orderly,
at the imminent peril of their lives, with orders to
ride after Mills and tell him to leave the cañon, defile to
the left, and rejoin him at once. Crook hoped that
Mills, on his return to the field, might succeed in getting
in the rear of any Indians who might be lurking
in the hills before Royall’s shattered line.</p>

<p class='c000'>So rapid had been Mills’ movements, that Nickerson,
although going at the full speed of his horse, did not overtake
him until he had penetrated some seven miles down
the cañon. Fortunately for all concerned, the command
had halted where a cross cañon made an opening
toward the west, and on that side the cañon was so
broken and so sloping that it could be scaled by the
troopers. Firing was heard to the front, and the Indians
were detected massing to attack Mills’ detachment.
A halt had been ordered for the purpose of
making final preparations for the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mills,” said Nickerson, as he came galloping up,
“Royall has been badly handled—there are many
wounded. Henry is severely hurt, and Vroom’s troop
is all cut up. The General orders that you and Noyes
defile by your left flank out of this cañon and return to
the field at once. He cannot move out to support you
and the rest on account of the wounded.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Never was order more unwelcome. The officers at
the head of the column urged Mills to go on. The Indian
village was in sight. Crook could not have known
how near they were, or he would not have recalled them.
Mills, however, was a thorough soldier. In his mind
orders were to be obeyed, and he silenced the objectors
and advisers, and did as he was directed, although with
great disappointment and reluctance. Never was obedience
better justified. General Mills admits now that, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>he disobeyed Crook, his command would have been
annihilated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cañon was the mouth of Crazy Horse’s trap. A
short distance farther on, it ended in a great dam covered
with broken logs, making a dangerous abattis. Here
the main body of the Indians had been massed. Here
they expected, seeing the confident advance of the eight
troops of cavalry up the cañon, to fall upon them and
kill them all, which they might easily have done. Nickerson
got there just in time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills instantly turned to the left and led his troops
up the broken wall of the cañon to the high ground on
the farther side; fortunately, he had been overtaken at
about the very point where the ascent was practicable
for troops. Presently the detachment rejoined the main
body, their progress being unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were ten soldiers killed and twenty-seven seriously
wounded, besides a great number of slightly
wounded. Most of the casualties were in Royall’s
command, Vroom’s troop having lost heavily while it
was in such peril.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook camped for the night on the battle-field. The
dead were buried, the wounded looked after temporarily,
and the next morning the soldiers withdrew.
They went back to their camp at Goose Creek and
stayed there. The battle was in one sense a victory for
the white soldiers, in that they drove the Indians from
the field, forcing them back at least five miles. In another,
and a larger and more definite sense, it was a decided
victory for Crazy Horse. He had fought Crook
to a standstill. He had forced him back to his base of
supplies. He had stopped the farther progress of that
expedition. He had protected his villages and had
withdrawn his army in good order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>If Mills’ command had not been recalled, it is certain
that it would have been annihilated. As it was, the
Indians had done remarkably well. Crazy Horse, free
from further apprehension of pursuit by Crook for the
present, had leisure to turn his attention to the other two
expeditions, which there is no doubt he was well aware
had been launched against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>While technically it was perhaps a drawn battle, as a
feat of arms the battle of the Rosebud must go down
to the credit of the Indians. It was more like a pitched
battle than any that had been fought west of the Missouri
heretofore. The individual officers and soldiers
of the army did splendidly; so did the Indians. Mills
had displayed commendable dash and daring in all his
charges. Royall, Henry and Van Vliet, and Chambers
with the infantry, had fought skilfully and bravely
against an overwhelming force. Crook’s dispositions
were good on the field, and were well carried out by his
subordinates. The same may be said of Crazy Horse,
his subchiefs, and their warriors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook had nearly exhausted his ammunition in the
hard fighting, the larger part of his supplies had been expended,
and he had a number of very seriously wounded
on his hands. There was not one chance in a thousand
that he could catch the Indians now. There was nothing
left for him to do but go back to the main camp, send
his wounded back to Fort Fetterman for treatment, order
up more supplies and more troops, and await a favorable
opportunity to attack again.</p>

<p class='c000'>To anticipate events, it may be noted that, owing to the
disaster to Terry’s column, Crook did not advance until
August.</p>

a characteristic anecdote of Royall, which I venture to quote as illustrating the way
they have in the army, and as throwing some light on the temperament of the peppery
old fighter:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A story is going the rounds about Royall that does us all good, even in that dismal
weather. A day or two before, so it was told, Royall ordered one of his battalion commanders
to ‘put that battalion in camp on the other side of the river, facing east.’ A
prominent and well-known characteristic of the subordinate officer referred to was a
tendency to split hairs, discuss orders, and, in fine, to make trouble where there was a
ghost of a chance of so doing unpunished. Presently the colonel saw that his instructions
were not being carried out, and, not being in a mood for indirect action, he put
spurs to his horse, dashed through the stream, and reined up alongside the victim with:</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Didn’t I order you, sir, to put your battalion in camp along the river, facing
east?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Yes, sir; but this ain’t a river. It’s only a creek.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Creek be d—d, sir! It’s a river—a river from this time forth, <em>by order</em>, sir. Now
do as I tell you!’</p>

but kept him a prisoner until he could recover what they believed to be his native tongue—the
Sioux. Frank remained several years in the household of the great chief ‘Crazy
Horse,’ whom he knew very well, as well as his medicine man, the since renowned
‘Sitting Bull.’ Gruard was one of the most remarkable woodsmen I have ever met;
no Indian could surpass him in his intimate acquaintance with all that pertained to the

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>I am afraid that any attempt on my part to comply
with your request will be a very feeble attempt
to describe to you the Battle of the Rosebud,
which took place on June 17th, 1876. There are
many men living who participated in that battle who
can describe more fully and more comprehensively than
I the details of that day. However, I will do my best.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 16th day of June, 1876, General Crook with
his command was camped on the Tongue River awaiting
the arrival of three hundred Crow and Shoshone
Indians to be used as scouts, under Frank Gruard, a
noted scout of the Indian country, it being Crook’s intention
thoroughly to scout the whole country from the
Powder and Tongue Rivers north to the Yellowstone,
and to co-operate with the other columns in the field
under Custer, Terry, and Gibbon.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about five <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> on the afternoon of June 16th the
three hundred scouts came into our camp, and shortly
afterward General Crook gave orders to the command
to prepare for a night march. Extra ammunition and
extra rations were issued, and at about eight <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> we
broke camp and mounted into the saddle to commence
our march into the Indian country, which was overrun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>by the Oglalas, Brulés, Unkpapas, and Miniconjous,
the four most powerful tribes of Sioux Indians on the
plains, for it is to be remembered that the whole Sioux
Nation had left their reservations and was then on the
war-path.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Crook had, on the morning of the 16th, sent
out scouts to find and report any Indian signs that might
be found. Numerous signs were found which indicated
that a large party of Indians had recently passed
that way going in a northerly direction, with the evident
intention of joining those from the Brulé agency on the
Yellowstone. It was General Crook’s purpose to
cut them off. Thus the forced march of the night of
the 16th.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c007'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>After a long and tiresome journey of all night, about
seven <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> of the 17th Indians were seen on the hills
to our front and left who were evidently watching our
movements. It was reported to General Crook by the
scouts that we had gotten into a country that was completely
alive with hostile Indians and that we were near
an immense Indian camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Crook at about 7.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> went into camp
with the intention of making another night march and,
if possible, overtake their camp the next day. As we had
been in the saddle all night, men and horses needed a
few hours rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>After going into camp we unsaddled and put our
horses to graze, but first hobbling them to prevent any
stampede that might be attempted. While we were
putting our horses to graze the whole range of hills in
our front became literally alive with Indians, and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>same time the Crow and Shoshone Indians with us commenced
their warlike preparations by daubing themselves
with war paint and riding their ponies in a circle
one behind the other, and at the same time singing their
war songs.</p>

<p class='c000'>After riding in this manner a short while, the circle
broke and the whole group of Indian scouts charged up
the hill toward their enemies. It is a well known fact
that the Sioux and Crow Indians were enemies toward
each other at that time. I have seen the Crow Indians
shoot buffalo and let them lie where they fell, not even
undertaking to remove the hide, because, they would say,
“Sioux Buffalo no good,” which indicated that as the
Sioux Indians were their enemies, so were the buffalo
found in the Sioux country their enemies also. Everything
in the Sioux country was an enemy to the Crow
Indian.</p>

<p class='c000'>While our Indians were making their charge upon the
Sioux, General Crook gave orders to saddle up, for well
he knew that a battle was on hand. After we had saddled
and formed in line, my troop, F, Third Cavalry,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c007'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
was placed on the left flank of the command, and it with
two other troops were detailed as skirmishers and were
ordered to make a flank movement to our left and gain
the hills, where we dismounted, leaving each fourth
trooper to hold the horses. We then formed the skirmish
line on foot, which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Royall.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time I witnessed a most daring act by a bugler
by the name of Snow, who was carrying a despatch from
General Crook to Colonel Royall. General Crook was
stationed on one of the hills to our right, near the center
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of the line,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c007'><sup>[65]</sup></a> where he could view all that was taking
place. Wishing to send an order to Colonel Royall, he
directed his orderly, Bugler Snow, to carry it with all
haste. The most direct route was down a steep hill
and across a level plain and then up another hill, where
Colonel Royall was. All chances of reaching there
alive were against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I saw him he was coming as fast as his horse
could carry him, while two Indians were after him with
the intention of capturing him. Seeing that they could
not capture him, they finished the game by shooting at
him, and proved their good marksmanship as poor Snow
fell from his horse, shot through both arms, but he
delivered his orders all right.</p>

<p class='c000'>After remaining on the skirmish line for perhaps two
hours, we were ordered to fall back and remount our
horses to take a new position (our horses were held in
check in a ravine), as it was impossible to hold our present
position against such overwhelming odds. I must
say that I never saw so great a body of Indians in one
place as I saw at that time, and I have seen a great many
Indians in my time. It seemed that if one Indian was
shot five were there to take his place. If we had remained
in our first position we would all have been
killed, and I consider that we retreated in the right
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had not gone more than one third of the distance
from our position to where the horses were when I overtook
three other soldiers of my own troop carrying a
sergeant by the name of Marshall, who had been shot
through the face. I knew that time was precious and
none to lose. I could not give them the cold shoulder
by passing them without giving a helping hand. Glancing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>back, I saw the hostiles coming over the hill. I said
to the others, “Quick, here they come!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At that instant my comrades, to save themselves,
dropped the wounded sergeant and hastened to their
horses. The sergeant, seeing that I was the only one
left, said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Save yourself if you can, because I am dying. Don’t
stay with me.” I replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dave, old boy, I am going to stay right here with
you and will not desert you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Grasping him with all my strength, I carried my comrade
until it was useless to carry him any farther, for he
was dead. I then laid him down and left him and hurried
to get away.</p>

<p class='c000'>I don’t think that I had gone more than ten yards
when I was surrounded by about twenty or more of the
most murderous looking Indians I ever saw. You can
talk of seeing devils; here they were in full form, painted
in the most terrifying manner, some with their war bonnets
adorned with horns of steers and buffalo. It was
enough to strike terror to anyone’s heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew that my time had come, I knew that I would
be taken prisoner. I fought, but it was fighting against
terrible odds. There I was down in that ravine, alone
and in the midst of a lot of murderous savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking my carbine from me and throwing a lariat
over my head and tightening it about my feet, I was
helpless. This was all done in an instant, while I struggled
and fought in vain, until I was struck on the head
with something which rendered me unconscious and
caused me to fall. As I went down a bullet struck me
in the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think that when the bullet struck me I regained
my consciousness, because I realized I was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>dragged at a lively pace over the ground by a pony at
the other end of the lariat. It was, I think, the intention
of the Indians either to drag me to death at the
heels of the pony or after getting me away to torture
me in some other manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>They captured one other comrade of mine by the
name of Bennett, of L Troop, Third Cavalry, and completely
cut him in pieces. His remains were buried in
a grain sack.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I was dragged in this manner for some distance,
my captors were charged by one of the troops of cavalry,
and to save themselves from capture abandoned me and
made their escape. Thus was I enabled to regain my
liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was immediately sent to the field hospital, and three
days later I, with eighteen other wounded men, was
sent to the post hospital at Fort Fetterman. You ask
in your letter did I get a medal of honor for trying to get
my sergeant away. I am very sorry to say that I did
not, although I do think that even at this late day had I

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. The Yellowstone Expedition of 1873</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Having thus disposed of the most formidable
column, Crook’s, in so summary and
so effective a manner, the Indians under
their able leadership turned their attention
to Custer and Gibbon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the Little Big Horn campaign is discussed,
however, in order the better to understand the most
terribly dramatic episode in the most disastrous of our
Indian battles, it will be necessary to go back a little
and take up the thread of the discourse later.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country watered by the Yellowstone and its
affluents, traversed by the Black Hills and other ranges
of mountains, and protected by the almost impassable
Bad Lands in Dakota, had been up to 1873 practically
a terra incognita. However, the Northern Pacific
Railroad was even then surveying a route across it.
Gold had been discovered, and miners and settlers were
crowding in. The Indians, since the treaty of 1868,
which had resulted in the abandonment of Fort Phil
Kearney and the other posts, had been ugly in mood and
troublesome in action. They welcomed neither railroad
nor men.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>An expedition of some seventeen hundred men under
General Stanley was sent into the country in 1873. Custer
and the Seventh Cavalry formed a large part of the
command. There were no guides. The country, especially
in the Bad Lands, was a terrible one to cross, and
Custer volunteered to take two troops of cavalry and
ride some miles ahead of the main body every day to
mark a road. Custer possessed a faculty for this sort
of work which was simply marvelous. He was a born
pathfinder, better even than Frémont.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th of August he left camp at five o’clock in
the morning with the troops of Moylan and Tom Custer,
eighty-six men, five officers, and a favorite Arikara
scout, called Bloody Knife. At ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, reaching
the crest of some bluffs along the river bank, they
saw spread before them a beautiful village, through
which the river gently meandered between the tree-clad
banks. They advanced two miles up the valley, and
made camp under the trees for a noonday rest. They
had come at a smart pace and were far ahead of the
main column, which was out of sight in the rear. The
passage through the valley was easy, and there was no
necessity for them to press on. The weather was hot.
After picketing the horses, partaking of their noonday
meal and posting sentries, officers and men threw themselves
on the grass and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one o’clock the sentry on the edge of the timber
gave the alarm. A small party of Indians was approaching,
in the hope of stampeding the horses. All
Indian attacks begin that way. After the horses are
stampeded the soldiers have to fight where they are,
and, as the Indians are mounted, the dismounted
troopers are at a disadvantage. Custer was on his feet
in an instant, shouting:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Run to your horses, men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The troopers were no less alert. Before the Indians
could stampede the horses, each man had reached his
animal and led him back into the timber. A few shots
drove off the little party of savages, the horses were saddled,
and the men moved out. As they did so, six mounted
Indians appeared on the crest of a little hill. Custer
led the way toward them. They retreated slowly, keeping
just out of range. In this manner they drew the soldiers
some two miles up the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, in the hope of getting near to them, Custer
took twenty men, with his brother and Lieutenant Varnum
in command, and rode out some two hundred
yards ahead of the remainder under Captain Moylan,
who were directed to keep that distance in rear of the
advance. Custer, accompanied only by an orderly,
rode about the same distance ahead of the advance,
making peace signs to the six Indians whom they had
pursued. As he approached nearer to them, their pace
slackened and they suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the left of the soldiers was a thick wood. It
occurred to Custer that Indians might be concealed
therein, and he sent his orderly back to the advance to
caution them to be on their guard. Scarcely had the
orderly reached the advance when the Indians they
had been pursuing turned and came at full gallop
toward Custer, now alone in the valley. At the same
instant, with a terrific war whoop, three or four hundred
splendidly mounted Sioux burst out from the trees on
the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer was riding a magnificent thoroughbred. In a
second he was racing for his life toward the advance-guard.
The Indians had two objects in view. They
wanted to intercept Custer and also cut off the advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>party from Moylan’s men, who were coming up at a
gallop. Only the speed of Custer’s horse saved his life.
As he galloped toward them, he shouted to Tom Custer
to dismount his men. He was not heard in the confusion,
but young Custer knew exactly what to do.
While five men held the horses, the other fifteen threw
themselves on the ground. On came the Indians after
Custer. As soon as they were within easy range, the
dismounted men blazed away right in their faces.
The troopers were armed with breech-loaders, and the
first volley was succeeded by a second. Several of the
savages were hit and many of their horses. They reeled,
swerved, and Custer rejoined his men. A few moments
after, Moylan came up with the main body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer now dismounted most of his men, and keeping
a bold front to the Indians, retreated in the timber,
fighting hard all the way. Reaching the river, they made
good their defense. The Indians tried all their devices
to get them out. They set fire to the grass, but it was
green and did not burn readily. All their efforts to
dislodge the troopers failed, and late in the afternoon
a heavy squadron came up on the gallop from the main
body under Stanley and put them to flight. It was a
sharp affair, and the Indians suffered severely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only losses to the expedition on that day were
two civilians: Doctor Honzinger, a fat old German, who
was the veterinarian of the regiment, and Mr. Baliran,
the sutler. They were both quiet, inoffensive, peaceable
men, very much liked, especially the doctor. They
were amateur naturalists, and frequently wandered
away from the main body on botanizing excursions.
They had done so that morning, following Custer’s advance,
and the Indians had fallen upon them and murdered
them. It was the discovery of the remains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>these two men which had caused General Stanley to
despatch the cavalry to the relief of the advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bitter was the anger of the officers and men over this
murder of unarmed non-combatants, and deep and
abiding was their thirst for vengeance on the Indians
who perpetrated it.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Capture of Rain-in-the-Face</h4>

<p class='c020'>The next year, 1874, the Seventh Cavalry being stationed
at Fort Abraham Lincoln, near Bismarck, on the
upper Missouri, word was brought to Custer by a scout
that a famous Sioux, called by the picturesque name of
Rain-in-the-Face, was at Standing Rock Agency, some
twenty miles away, boasting that he had killed Doctor
Honzinger and Mr. Baliran. Rain-in-the-Face was
already a renowned warrior, of more than ordinary
courage. That he should have left the hostiles under
Sitting Bull to come to the agency was a thing implying
peculiar bravery; and that he should there openly boast
of the murder was even more extraordinary. Custer
immediately determined upon his capture, although to
effect it would be a matter of difficulty and danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The agency was filled with Indians waiting for the
issue of rations; and, though they were on a peaceable
errand, they were always unruly, insubordinate, and
on the alert. Captain Yates and Captain Tom Custer,
with one hundred troopers, were detailed to make the
arrest. The arrival of one hundred men at the agency
instantly excited the suspicion of the Indians. To divert
it from the real object, Captain Yates ostentatiously
detached a lieutenant with fifty men to ride to some
villages ten miles away in quest of certain Indians who
had some time before raided a settlement and run off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>some stock, killing the herders. With the remainder
he purposed to wait for the return of the detachment.
Meanwhile it was learned from a scout that Rain-in-the-Face
was in the sutler’s store.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Custer, with five picked men, was ordered to
enter the store and make the arrest. The store was full
of Indians. The weather was very cold, and the Indians
kept their blankets well around their faces. It was impossible
to tell one from another. Tom Custer had
received a good description of Rain-in-the-Face, however,
but it availed him nothing under the circumstances.
He and his men, therefore, mingled freely with the
Indians from time to time, making small purchases of
the sutler to divert suspicion as they lounged about the
store. They deceived the savages entirely, in spite of
their watchful scrutiny and suspicion. At last one Indian
dropped his blanket and stepped to the counter,
either to speak to the trader or to make a purchase.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Rain-in-the-Face. Custer recognized him immediately.
Stepping behind him, he threw his arms
about him and seized him in an iron grasp. The Indian,
who had observed the movement too late, attempted
to fire his Winchester; but Custer was too quick for
him. The five troopers sprang to the side of their captain,
disarmed Rain-in-the-Face, and presented their
guns to the astonished and infuriated Indians. The
room was filled with seething excitement in a moment.
The Indians surged toward the troopers, and perhaps
would have made short work of them, had not Captain
Yates at this juncture entered the room with a detail
of his men.</p>

<p>THE CAPTURE OF RAIN-IN-THE-FACE<br /><br /><em>Drawing by E. W. Demian</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Rain-in-the-Face, a magnificent specimen of Indian
manhood, had ceased to struggle the moment he was
convinced that it was unavailing. He was led outside,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>securely bound and mounted on a horse. The troopers
were assembled, and in spite of threats and menaces by
the Indians, who did not venture to attack, they started
back to Fort Lincoln with their prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Messengers were sped in every direction to the different
bands of Indians to mass a force to release Rain-in-the-Face,
who was a man of such importance, being
the brother of Iron Horse, one of the principal chiefs of
the Unkpapas, that no price was counted too great to
secure his liberty; indeed, before starting, they had
offered Yates two warriors in exchange for him. The
rapidity with which the troops moved was such that the
prisoner was safely imprisoned at Fort Lincoln before
anything could be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain-in-the-Face stubbornly refused to say anything
for a day or two, but finally made full confession that he
had shot Mr. Baliran and wounded Doctor Honzinger,
who had fallen from his horse, whereupon he had
crushed his head with stones. He was put in the guard-house
preparatory to being tried for murder, and kept
there in spite of the efforts to release him that were made
by many prominent Indians. In the same guard-house
were some civilians who had been caught stealing grain.
One bitterly cold night, during a raging blizzard, the civilians,
with some outside assistance, succeeded in making
their escape. Rain-in-the-Face took advantage of
the opportunity and left also. He joined the hostiles
under Sitting Bull, and sent back word that he intended
to have his revenge on the Custers for the treatment he
had received.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER FOUR<br /> <span class='large'>The Little Big Horn Campaign</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Custer Loses His Command</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>To return to the spring of 1876. When the
column which Custer was to have commanded
moved out, Custer led his own regiment, while
Major-General Alfred H. Terry was in personal
command of the column. I give the reason
in the words of General George A. Forsyth in a recent
letter to me:</p>

<p class='c000'>“For some reason Custer, one of the most splendid
soldiers that ever lived, hated General Belknap, the
Secretary of War. He was a good hater, too. When
General Belknap was imprisoned and undergoing trial
Custer wrote that he knew of certain things regarding
the appointment of post-traders on the upper Missouri
River, which things the prosecution thought were what
they needed to insure conviction. As a matter of fact,
Custer did not know anything. He had heard disappointed
men who had failed to get said post-traderships
curse Belknap and say that they knew Belknap
had sold the traderships to the appointees. It was not so.
Belknap had given these appointments to certain able
Iowa politicians for their friends, in order to secure their
influence in the next campaign for United States Senator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>from Iowa, as he had determined to try for a senatorship
from his state, viz., Iowa.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was entirely within his own right to make these
appointments and there was really nothing wrong in
doing so. Of course the disappointed applicants were
furious, and especially certain men who had served with
Belknap during the Civil War and who thought they
had a claim on him. They could not tell lies fast
enough about Belknap and especially to Custer, who was
thoroughly honest and believed what they said. This
was what Custer thought he knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Custer was summoned to Washington of course.
When he was questioned by the House Committee of prosecution
it was apparent that he did not know anything.
His evidence was all hearsay and not worth a tinker’s
dam. The President—General Grant—was indignant
at Custer’s statements regarding Belknap, which turned
out to be all hearsay.... The President directed
General Sherman not to permit Custer to take the field
against Sitting Bull—undoubtedly to punish him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will recall that Belknap was—in a sort of
Scotch verdict way, ‘Not proven, my lord’—acquitted.
It was only upon the strong, insistent and urgent
request of General Sheridan to General Sherman—the
then Commanding General of the Army—that the
President finally said that if General Sheridan regarded
Custer’s services of great importance in the campaign,
Sherman might authorize Sheridan to permit him to
join his regiment and serve under General Terry, who
was appointed to command the expedition. Sherman
wired Sheridan what the President said, and Sheridan
at once applied for Custer as in his opinion ‘necessary.’<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c007'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“I was in Europe at the time of the Custer disaster,
and on my return to General Sheridan’s headquarters
I saw all the correspondence in the case.”</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>Therefore, instead of commanding the column, Custer
was placed under Terry, who was to command Gibbon’s
column as well, when the junction had been made between
the two. On the 17th of May the command left
Fort Lincoln. The seriousness of the situation was felt
as never before in an Indian campaign. It was realized
that no child’s play was before the troops, and it was
with unusual gravity that the regiment marched away.
Mrs. Custer tells how General Terry ordered the force
to parade through Fort Lincoln to reassure the women
and children left behind by the sight of its formidable
appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best part of the expedition was the Seventh
Cavalry, six hundred strong, with Custer at its head.
The band played “Garry Owen,” the famous battle
tune of the Washita, as they marched away. They
halted on the prairie afterward, and an opportunity was
given to the officers and men to say good-by to the
dear ones to be left behind; then, to the music of “The
Girl I Left Behind Me,” they started on that campaign
from which half of them never came back.</p>

<p class='c000'>They reached the Powder River without mishap, and
were there joined by General Gibbon, who reported his
command encamped along the Yellowstone, near the
mouth of the Big Horn. Major Reno, of the Seventh
Cavalry, with six troops had been sent on a scouting
expedition to the southward, and had discovered a big
Indian trail leading westward toward the Big Horn
country. On the 17th of June Reno’s men had been
within forty miles of the place where Crook was fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>his fierce battle, although, of course, they knew nothing
of it at this time. On the 22d Custer was ordered to
take his regiment with fifteen days’ rations and march
down the Rosebud, thoroughly examining the country
en route until he struck the Indian trail reported by
Reno.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. Did Custer Obey His Orders?</h4>

<p class='c020'>And now we come to the most important question of
this remarkable campaign. On the one hand, General
Terry has been severely censured for its dire failure;
the death of Custer and the escape of the Indians have
been laid at his door. On the other hand, it has been
urged that Custer disobeyed his orders, broke up Terry’s
plan of campaign, and by his insubordination brought
about a terrible disaster and let slip the opportunity for
administering a crushing defeat to the Indians, which
probably would have ended the war and prevented a
deplorable loss of life, to say nothing of prestige and
treasure. Both officers had, and still have, their
partizans, and the matter has been thoroughly threshed
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>As between Custer and Terry, I profess absolute impartiality,
although, if I have any natural bias, it is
toward Custer, whose previous career, as I have investigated
it, appeals to me more than Terry’s, distinguished
as were the latter’s services. I have studied the
situation carefully, examining all the evidence published
by both sides, and very reluctantly, in spite of my liking
for poor Custer, I am compelled to admit that he
did disobey his orders; that his action did break up a
most promising plan, which, it is highly probable, would
have resulted in a decisive battle with the Indians and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the termination of the war; and that he, and he alone,
must be held responsible for the subsequent disaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Terry’s order to Custer, which follows, is entirely
clear and explicit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Camp at Mouth of Rosebud River, M. T.,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lieutenant-Colonel Custer, 7th Cavalry. Colonel:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The Brigadier-General Commanding directs that,
as soon as your regiment can be made ready for the
march, you will proceed up the Rosebud in pursuit of
the Indians whose trail was discovered by Major Reno
a few days since. It is, of course, impossible to give you
any definite instructions in regard to this movement,
and were it not impossible to do so, the Department
Commander places too much confidence in your zeal,
energy, and ability to wish to impose upon you precise
orders which might hamper your action when nearly in
contact with the enemy. He will, however, indicate to
you his own views of what your action should be, and
he desires that you should conform to them, unless you
should see sufficient reasons for departing from them.
He thinks that you should proceed up the Rosebud
until you ascertain definitely the direction in which the
trail above spoken of leads. Should it be found (as it
appears almost certain that it will be found) to turn
toward the Little Horn,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c007'><sup>[68]</sup></a> he thinks that you should still
proceed southward, perhaps as far as the head-waters of
the Tongue, and then turn toward the Little Horn, feeling
constantly, however, to your left, so as to preclude
the possibility of the escape of the Indians to the south
or southeast by passing around your left flank. The column
of Colonel Gibbon is now in motion for the mouth
of the Big Horn. As soon as it reaches that point it will
cross the Yellowstone and move up at least as far as the
forks of the Big and Little Horns. Of course its future
movements must be controlled by circumstances, as they
arise, but it is hoped that the Indians, if upon the Little
Horn, may be so nearly inclosed by the two columns
that their escape will be impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer was directed to march southward until he
struck the trail Reno had discovered. If, as Terry supposed,
it led across the Rosebud, he was not to follow it
westward to the Little Big Horn, or until he met the Indians,
but he was to turn to the southward until he
struck the head-waters of the Tongue River. If he
found no Indians there, he was to swing northward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>down the valley of the Little Big Horn, toward the spot
where Terry supposed the Indians to be, and where, in
reality, they were. Meanwhile Gibbon was to come up
the Little Big Horn from the north toward the same
spot. In the general plan of the campaign, Crook and
his force were supposed to prevent the Indians from
moving south—which they did, by the way. Custer was
to keep them from going east, and, as he advanced, was
“to feel to his left” to preclude all possibility of their slipping
between him and Crook, while Gibbon was to keep
them from going off to the north. The Indians would
have no direction open to them for flight except westward,
and in that case the troops hoped to overtake them in a
difficult country, inclosed by mountains and rivers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terry, although he was not an experienced Indian
fighter, had divined the position of the Indians with remarkable
accuracy, and he fully expected to find them
on the Little Big Horn. If Custer had followed Terry’s
orders, he would have reached the Indians on the day
that Gibbon’s men, as we shall see, rescued Reno. After
the disaster Terry magnanimously strove at first to conceal
from the public the fact that Custer had disobeyed
his orders. Custer had paid the penalty for his disobedience
with his life, and Terry was willing to bear the
odium of the defeat and failure. His self-sacrifice was
noble and characteristic; but a mistake, caused by the
carelessness of General Sherman, coupled with the enterprise
of a brilliant newspaper reporter, who posed as
a regularly accredited government messenger, defeated
Terry’s intent, and instead of the first report, which
made no allusion to the disobedience of orders, being
made public,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c007'><sup>[69]</sup></a> a second report, which told the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>story, and which was intended for the authorities alone,
was given to the press and immediately spread broadcast.
The first report soon turned up, and Terry thereafter was
made the victim of unmerited obloquy by Custer’s partizans,
who said that the absence of any mention in the
original report of any disobedience on the part of Custer,
and the alleged failure to allude to the plan of campaign
which Custer had frustrated, was evidence that no
importance was attached to the plan by Terry or any
one until after the failure and consequent popular
indignation. Terry’s answer to this was a noble silence,
to save Custer’s reputation. The living assumed the
responsibility to protect the fame of the dead—honor
to him!</p>

<p class='c000'>General Gibbon also has gone on record in a letter to
Terry regarding the situation:</p>

<p class='c022'>“So great was my fear that Custer’s zeal would carry
him forward too rapidly, that the last thing I said to him
when bidding him good-by after his regiment had filed
past you when starting on his march was, ‘Now, Custer,
don’t be greedy, but wait for us.’ He replied gaily as,
with a wave of his hand, he dashed off to follow his
regiment, ‘No, I will not.’ Poor fellow! Knowing
what we do now, and what an effect a fresh Indian trail
seemed to have had upon him, <em>perhaps we were expecting
too much to anticipate a forbearance on his part which
would have rendered coöperation of the two columns
practicable</em>.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c007'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>“Except so far as to draw profit from past experience,
it is perhaps useless to speculate as to what would have
been the result had your plan, as originally agreed upon,
been carried out. But I cannot help reflecting that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>that case my column, supposing the Indian camp to
have remained where it was when Custer struck it,
would have been the first to reach it; that with our infantry
and Gatling guns we should have been able to take
care of ourselves, even though numbering only about
two-thirds of Custer’s force; and that with six hundred
cavalry in the neighborhood, led as only Custer could
lead it, the result to the Indians would have been very
different from what it was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to Gibbon’s generous suggestion that
Custer was suddenly carried away by the opportunity
presented, the testimony of the late General Ludlow is
interesting. According to him, Custer stated on the
8th of May, in St. Paul, Minnesota, that he intended, at
the first chance he got in the campaign, to “cut loose
from (and make his operations independent of) General
Terry during the summer;” that he had “got away from
Stanley and would be able to swung clear of Terry.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c007'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult, nay, it is impossible, therefore, to acquit
Custer of a deliberate purpose to campaign on his own
account so soon as he could get away from General
Terry. The sentence of Terry’s orders commencing:
“It is, of course, impossible to give you any definite instructions,”
etc., and expressing confidence in his zeal
and energy, and Terry’s unwillingness to hamper him
with precise directions, when nearly in contact with the
enemy, did not warrant Custer in disobeying his orders.
<em>It was only to govern his conduct when he should be in
contact with the enemy</em>, in which case, of course, he would
have to be the sole judge of what was best to be done.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>His conduct in that case will be considered later. In
any event it has no bearing on the question of disobedience,
for the crux is here: had Custer obeyed orders,
he would not have come in contact with the enemy when
and where he did. The conditions would have differed
greatly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every student of military matters knows that the
words used, “He desires that you should conform to
them (his own views) unless,” etc., convey a direct, positive
command.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c007'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The abstract question of disobedience of orders is
one that has often been discussed. It is impossible
to maintain the position that an officer should never,
under any circumstances, disobey his orders. Circumstances
sometimes compel him to do so. But when an
officer commanding troops which are supposed to act in
coöperation with other troops receives orders to carry out
a certain specified detail of a stated general plan, and in
the exercise of his own discretion concludes to disobey
his orders and do something other than what he was
directed to do, he takes upon himself the onus of success
or failure, not merely of his own immediate manœuver,
but of the whole general plan. If the plan miscarries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>through his disobedience, whatever may have been his
motives, woe be unto him! If by his disobedience he
brings about the end at which the original plan aimed,
the defeat of the enemy, that is another proposition.
The event has then justified his disobedience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every soldier understands that reasons for disobedience
must be so clear, so convincing, and so unexpected,
that he is warranted in taking so prodigious a risk. Disregarding
for the moment, for the sake of argument,
General Ludlow’s testimony as to preconceived and
deliberate intent on Custer’s part to disobey, supposing
Custer’s disobedience to have been caused by some exigency
or crisis, we may ask ourselves what were the reasons
that caused him entirely to disregard Terry’s plan
and so to manœuver as to bring himself directly in touch
with the Indians in the shortest possible time, without
attempting either to examine Tullock’s Creek<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c007'><sup>[73]</sup></a> or to incline
to the southward—“feel with his left”? These
reasons—if any there were—can never be known, owing
to Custer’s death. It can only be said that no satisfactory
reasons appear which justify Custer’s action.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best that can be urged in defense of Custer is contained
in the following paragraph taken from Colonel
Godfrey’s <cite>Century</cite> article.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c007'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Had Custer continued his march southward—that
is, left the Indian trail—the Indians would have known
of our movements on the 25th and a battle would have
been fought very near the same field on which Crook had
been attacked and forced back only a week before; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Indians would never have remained in camp and allowed
a concentration of the several columns to attack
them. If they escaped without punishment or battle,
Custer would undoubtedly have been blamed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be pointed out with due reverence to Colonel
Godfrey—whom I consider one of the ablest officers in
the United States Army, by the way—that it is hard to
see how Custer could have been blamed for obeying his
orders, and that it is by no means certain that the Indians
would have discovered Custer’s column. Indeed,
his previous success in concealing his movements and
surprising the Indians (witness the Washita campaign)
leads me to believe that he could have carried out his
orders without observation. If Gibbon had struck the
Indians first and had held them in play Custer could
have annihilated them. General Fry’s comments in
the <cite>Century</cite> (appended to Colonel Godfrey’s article) on
Custer’s action are entirely wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to what would have happened if Custer had been
successful, it is more or less idle to speculate. Certainly,
if he had overwhelmingly defeated the Indians, I do not
think he would have been court-martialed; but if he had
been in Reno’s place and had been besieged with heavy
loss, then I feel certain that Terry would have been in
duty bound to prefer charges against him. All this is
beside the main question, however, and it is now time
to return to the history of the expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terry offered Custer four troops of the Second Cavalry
and two Gatling guns, which were refused. Custer said
that any force that was too big for the Seventh Cavalry
alone to deal with would be too big for the Seventh Cavalry
plus the four troops, and urged that the guns would
hamper and harass his movements. Terry, who elected
to go with Gibbon’s infantry column, agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Neither Terry nor Custer nor any one expected to
meet more than one thousand warriors. They had no
knowledge whatever of the large numbers of the so-called
peaceable Indians, for whom rations had been
regularly issued, who had broken away from the agencies
and joined the hostiles. They did not know of
Crook’s defeat, and the great effect it had in inducing
wavering bucks to give their allegiance to the brave
men on the war-path. It will, perhaps, be fair to estimate
the number of Indian warriors in the field at a
mean between the white and Indian accounts, which
range from twelve hundred on the one hand to three
thousand on the other. To be on the safe side, I shall
call it at least two thousand.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c007'><sup>[75]</sup></a> Whatever their number,
there were enough of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their way they were two thousand of the fiercest
and most desperate fighters on the face of the globe.
While they were undisciplined, untrained, and not entirely
amenable to one will, as were the soldiers, they
were, nevertheless, a fearfully formidable force. Their
common hatred of the white man gave them sufficient
coherence to form a rude but effective organization.
They were led by experienced chiefs and were used to
fighting. From 1868, after the close of the treaty by
which the frontier posts were abandoned and the country
restored to the Sioux and the Cheyennes, to 1876,
no less than two hundred distinct fights, like that
described in the account of the Yellowstone expedition,
had occurred between the soldiers and the
Indians. They were now to be tried in a real battle,
and, as we shall see, they were not found wanting;
for, in the end, all the honors of the campaign rested
with them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h4 class='c019'>III. Custer’s Expedition</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The Seventh Cavalry left the camp at the mouth of
the Powder River at twelve o’clock noon, on the 22d of
June, 1876. Generals Terry, Gibbon, and Custer reviewed
it as it marched away. With the column were
fifty Arikara (“Rees”) Indian auxiliaries, a few Crows,
and a number of white scouts and newspaper correspondents.
At four o’clock, after they had progressed
twelve miles, the march was halted, and that evening the
officers were summoned to Custer’s headquarters, and
marching instructions were given them. No bugle-calls
were to be sounded. The march was to be made with
the greatest possible rapidity; every officer was to look
carefully to his men and horses. Squadron and battalion
formations were abandoned; each troop commander
was to report to Custer in person.</p>

<p class='c000'>Custer was usually very uncommunicative. Ordinarily,
he kept his plans to himself until the time to strike
arrived. On this occasion, however, he announced his
purpose, which was to follow the trail until they found
the Indians, and then “go for them.” He was not “carried
away” by anything, and this declaration is further
evidence of his deliberate purpose. His manner, at all
times blunt and peremptory, not to say brusque, was
now entirely changed. He was usually full of cheerfulness
and confidence. There appeared to be a marked
absence of both qualities in this instance. Officers have
recorded that he seemed worried and depressed. It may
be that he was feeling the displeasure of Grant, which his
imprudent conduct had brought about. Perhaps the
serious character of the risk he was taking by his independent
move weighed upon him. If he succeeded, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>would regain all he had lost in the censure. If he failed—well,
he would not anticipate that. It was enough to
give a man serious thoughts. His letters to his wife
seem as cheerful and confident as ever, but, perhaps,
he may have affected that for her sake. At any rate,
the testimony as to his mental condition is unequivocal.</p>

<p class='c000'>However he may have felt, he acted with his usual
energy. Starting at five on the morning of the 23d, the
regiment went into camp at five in the afternoon, having
covered thirty-three miles over an execrable marching
country—the “Bad Lands.” On the 24th they marched
twenty-eight miles over an even worse territory. Indian
signs were abundant. Hundreds of Indians evidently
had passed. As no one could tell how near they
were to the hostiles, after supper on the 24th fires were
put out and the men were allowed to sleep until half
after eleven, while the officers and scouts examined the
trail. It was reported to Custer that it led straight
across the divide separating the Rosebud and the Little
Big Horn. At half after eleven the men were routed out
and marched ten miles toward the crest of the Little Big
Horn Mountains, which they reached at two o’clock in
the morning of Sunday, the 25th. A further halt was
made, and at eight o’clock the advance was taken up
once more.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They marched ten miles farther, and concealed themselves
in a large ravine near the divide and about
sixteen miles from the little Big Horn, about half after
ten in the morning. Smoke was seen trembling in the
air by the scouts in the crow’s nest on the top of the
divide, and there were other evidences of Indians down
the valley of the Little Big Horn. It is believed that
Custer intended to remain in hiding during the day, and
deliver his attack on the next morning. Unfortunately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>however, his trail had been crossed by the Indians. A
box of hard bread had fallen from one of the pack-mules
during the night march. When its loss was discovered,
a squad of men had been sent back for it. They found
an Indian trying to open it. He made his escape, and
would undoubtedly alarm the villages they were approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now we come to another problem. As the result
of his disobedience he was now practically in contact
with the enemy, although he should not have been. Being
in contact, however, what was he to do? There
were no orders to govern him now. He was thrown on
his own resources—just what he wanted, and what he
had schemed and planned for. How was he to deal
with his self-created opportunity?</p>

<p class='c000'>Believing, as he and every one else did, that the Indian
force did not greatly outnumber his own, an attack was
entirely feasible. Should he deliver that attack, or
should he wait to be attacked? The advantage is usually
with the attacking party in Indian warfare. Should
he seize or yield that? Suppose he decided not to attack
the Indians, and they moved away and escaped?
Would he not be censured for allowing them to get away,
since he had got in touch with them?</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose—remote contingency—he were not entirely
successful in his attack on the Indians? Gibbon must
be somewhere in the vicinity. A day or two would probably
bring him to the rescue. Could he not fight a waiting
battle, if necessary, until the other column arrived on
the field? Was it not absolutely incumbent upon him
to embrace the opportunity presented to him? He had
what he believed to be the finest regiment of cavalry in
the service. He had tried it, tested it, on many fields; he
knew, or thought he knew, the temper of his officers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>men. He decided to attack. Indeed, there was nothing
else for him to do. Fight he must. In the opinion of
distinguished military critics who have expressed themselves
upon the point, from General Sheridan down, he
was justified in his decision. In that opinion I concur.
And there is no evidence that he ever contemplated
doing anything else. He had arranged matters to bring
about the opportunity, and he had no hesitation in embracing
it. Evidently, he had absolutely no premonition
of defeat or disaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little before noon he communicated his intention
to his officers and men. He divided his regiment into
three battalions. To Major Marcus A. Reno,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c007'><sup>[76]</sup></a> an
officer with no experience in Indian fighting, he gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Troops A, G, and M; to Captain Benteen, a veteran and
successful Indian fighter, Troops D, H, and K; Captain
McDougall, with Troop B, was ordered to bring up the
mule train and take it in charge; Custer himself took the
five remaining troops, C, E, F, I, and L.</p>

<p class='c000'>They left the ravine, and about noon crossed the divide
which separated them from Little Big Horn Valley.
Benteen was ordered to swing over to the left and search
the country thoroughly in that direction, driving any
hostiles he might come across into the village and preventing
any escape of the Indians to the southward and
westward. Reno was to follow a small creek, sometimes
called Reno’s Creek, to its junction with the Little
Big Horn and strike the head of the village, supposed to
be there. Custer’s movements would be determined
subsequently, although for the present he followed Reno.
McDougall came last, following their trail with the
slow-moving train, which dropped rapidly to the rear
as the others proceeded at a smart pace. Benteen at
once moved off to the westward, while Reno, followed
by Custer, started down toward the valley of the Little
Big Horn.</p>

<p class='c000'>This river is a rapid mountain stream of clear, cold
water, with a pebbly bottom, from twenty to forty yards
wide. The depth of the water varies from two to five
feet. While it is very tortuous, the general direction of
the stream is northward to the Big Horn, which flows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>into the Yellowstone. The valley, from half a mile to a
mile in width, is bordered by the bare bluffs. Along the
river in places are thick clumps of trees. The Indian
camp, the end of which they could see as they crossed
the divide, was strung along the valley for several miles.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i_296.jpg' alt='Map to illustrate the route of the three battalions at the Little Big Horn' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Reno’s advance down the creek took him near to the
east bank of river. Custer had followed him, slightly
on his right flank. When Reno discovered the head of
the village in the valley, he crossed the creek to Custer
and reported what he had seen. Custer directed him to
cross the river, move down the valley, and attack in
force, informing him that he would be “supported” by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Custer’s battalion. Reno accordingly put his battalion
to a fast trot in columns of four, crossed the Little Big
Horn River beyond the mouth of the creek, and proceeded
onward for perhaps half a mile. Then he threw
his troops in line, reaching from the river to the bluffs
on the left, with the Arikara scouts on the left flank,
and galloped down the valley for a mile farther.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c007'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Reno stated subsequently that he believed that Custer
intended to keep behind him all the time; and he
fully expected, should he come in contact with Indians,
that Custer would be on hand to join in the attack.
Custer, however, had not continued down the creek or
crossed the river with Reno, but had swung off to the
high bluffs on the right bank of the creek, east of the
river. Reno mistook the purport of Custer’s statement.
In order to support an attack, it is not necessary to get
behind it. A flank attack or a demonstration in force,
from some other direction, frequently may be the best
method of supporting an attack. Custer’s plan was entirely
simple. Reno was to attack the end of the village.
Benteen was to sweep around and fall on the left of it,
Custer on the right. The tactics in the main were those
which had been used so successfully in the Battle of the
Washita (q.v.), and were much in vogue among our
Indian fighters during the Indian wars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dividing forces in the face of an enemy to make several
simultaneous attacks is dangerous, because it is
almost impossible to secure a proper coöperation
between the attacking units. A skilful general will concentrate
his force upon the separately approaching and
more or less isolated units and beat them in detail.
Washington’s tactics at Germantown were similar to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>those of Custer; and his force, which would have swept
the British from the field if his plans had been carried
out, was beaten in detail for lack of coördination in the
separate attacks. Some of Napoleon’s most brilliant
battles were fought when he occupied interior lines and
by successive attacks broke up converging columns.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still, the Indians were not believed to be veteran tacticians,
although everybody underestimated their qualities.
They were extremely liable to panic. A sudden
attack or a surprise almost always disorganized them
and threw them into confusion. Under the peculiar circumstances,
I think there is little question that Custer’s
tactics were entirely sound and well considered, although
this conclusion is often disputed. Where Custer made
a mistake appears to be in his failure to take greater precautions
that the attacks should be delivered simultaneously.
He had a much longer distance to go than Reno
and over a much worse country before he could attack,
and he was not at all sure as to where Benteen was or
when he could join. Nevertheless, the chances of success
were many, the chances of failure few, and I have
no doubt that Custer would have been successful had
there not been a woeful lack of conduct on the part of his
principal subordinate.</p>

paragraph:</p>

<p class='c000'>“At a conference which took place on the 21st between Colonel Gibbon, Lieutenant-Colonel
Custer, and myself, I communicated to them the plan of operations
which I had decided to adopt. It was that Colonel Gibbon’s column should cross
the Yellowstone near the mouth of the Little Big Horn, and thence up that stream,
with the expectation that it would arrive at that point by the 26th; that Lieutenant-Colonel
Custer with the whole of the Seventh Cavalry should proceed up the Rosebud
until he should ascertain the direction in which the trail discovered by Major
Reno led; that if it led to the Little Big Horn it should not be followed, but that
Lieutenant-Colonel Custer should keep still further to the south before turning
toward that river, in order to intercept the Indians should they attempt to pass
around to his left, and in order, by a longer march, to give time for Colonel Gibbon’s
column to come up.”</p>

upon his conduct as a pivot, the fortunes of the day turned, it is well to say something of
his record, which I have compiled from official sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was graduated from West Point in 1857, and was immediately appointed to the
First Dragoons, and had risen to a captaincy in the First Cavalry at the outbreak of the
Civil War. His career during the war was one of distinction. He was brevetted major,
March 17, 1863, for gallant and meritorious services at Kelly’s Ford, and lieutenant-colonel
for gallant and meritorious services at the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19,
1864. On January 1, 1865, he was appointed colonel of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Volunteer
Cavalry, and was brevetted brigadier-general of Volunteers at the close of the
war. Here is a brave and honorable record. Would that it might never have been
tarnished!</p>

<p class='c000'>He joined the Seventh Cavalry December 19, 1869, as major. He had had no Indian
service prior to that time, and his services up to the present campaign comprised a three
months’ scouting expedition in Colorado in the summer of 1870. In 1879, upon his own
application, a court of inquiry was convened for the purpose of investigating his conduct
at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. It was the opinion of the court that no further
proceedings were necessary in the case. One sentence of the record is significant: “The
conduct of the officers throughout was excellent, and while subordinates in some instances
did more for the safety of the command by brilliant displays of courage than did
Major Reno, there was nothing in his conduct which requires animadversion from this
court.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His relations with General Custer had not been friendly; so inimical were they,
in fact, that Custer was begged, before starting on the fatal campaign, not to intrust
the command of any supporting movement to Reno. Custer refused to allow any
such personal considerations to prevent Reno receiving the command to which his
rank entitled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1880 Major Reno was found guilty, by a general court-martial, of conduct unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman. While in an intoxicated condition he had engaged
in a brawl in a public billiard saloon, in which he assaulted another officer, destroyed
property, and otherwise conducted himself disgracefully. The court sentenced him to
be dismissed from the military service of the United States. The sentence was approved
by President Hayes, and Major Reno ceased to be an officer of the Army in April, 1880.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is painful to call attention to these facts, especially as Major Reno has since died;
but the name and fame of a greater than he have been assailed for his misconduct, and
in defense of Custer it is absolutely necessary that Reno’s character and services should
be thoroughly understood. For a further discussion of Major Reno’s conduct, see
Appendix B.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Reno’s Failure at the Little Big Horn</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>It will be necessary, in order clearly to comprehend
the complicated little battle, to treat each of the
three operations separately, and then see how they
were related to one another.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Reno’s men trotted down the valley, they saw,
some distance ahead of them and to the right across the
river on a line of high bluffs, Custer attended by his staff.
The general waved his hat at them encouragingly, and
disappeared over the brow of the hill. That glimpse of
Custer, standing on that hill with outstretched arm gallantly
waving his troopers on to battle, was the last any
one of his comrades in the valley had of him in life; and
it is certain that Reno must have realized then that
Custer was not following him, and that he was expected
to attack in his front alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, Reno, having drawn near to the village,
deployed his skirmishers, and slowly advanced down
the valley. In a few moments they were hotly engaged
with a constantly growing force of Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, one thing about the battle that followed is the
utter unreliability of the Indian reports of their movements.
It is alleged that fear of punishment made them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and keeps them reticent and uncommunicative. Different
Indians tell different stories. Most of these stories
disagree in their essential details, and it is impossible to
reconcile them. It may be that the faculties of the Indians
are not sufficiently alert to enable them to recall
the general plan of the battle, or at least to relate it,
although they knew well enough how to fight it at the
time. Their accounts are haphazard to the last degree.
Some say that they knew nothing of the advent of the
troops until Reno’s men deployed in the valley. At any
rate, they had sufficient time, on account of his dilatory
and hesitating advance, to assemble in heavy force.
Reno had less than one hundred and fifty men with him.
Even if Dr. Eastman’s estimate,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c007'><sup>[78]</sup></a> that the Indians numbered
but twelve hundred warriors, be true, they still
outnumbered Reno, although, owing to the fact that the
villages were strung along the river for several miles, only
a portion of them were at first engaged with the troops.
Flushed with their previous victory over Crook a short
time before, these Indians now fell upon Reno like a
storm.</p>

    <div>SOME OF CUSTER’S OFFICERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Reno’s line extended clear across the valley, which was
quite narrow where the battle was joined, the right flank
protected by the river, the left by the bluffs. Recovering
from their alleged panic, possibly because of the
feeble advance of the soldiers, the Indians rallied, and
with wonderful generalship massed their attack on the
left flank, which was most unfortunately held by the
Arikara scouts. No Arikara that ever lived was a
match for the Sioux or the Cheyennes. The Rees, as
these Indian auxiliaries were called, broke and fled incontinently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>They never stopped until they reached the
supply camp on the Powder River, miles away. At the
same time the horses of two troopers in the command
ran away with them, and plunged straight into the
Indian lines with their riders. Their fate was plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Ree scouts broke, the Indians turned Reno’s
left flank. The troopers gave way at once. There was
no reserve which could be thrown upon the Indians until
the line was restored. The whole force was slammed
back, like a door, into the timber on the bank of
the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Reno made a serious mistake. After rallying
his men, he ordered them to dismount. Cavalry may
be dismounted for defense, but sound judgment and
military usage demand that for an attack, especially
upon an Indian village of that kind, they should charge
upon horseback. As one veteran cavalryman has
written me, “I never could understand why Reno did
not charge desperately on the Indians in front of him.
His dismounting his men was against all sound military
judgment. ‘Audacity, always audacity,’ is the motto
for a cavalryman.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c007'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Had Reno been governed by this
principle and charged, as he should have done, the
result would have been different.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c007'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The position was instantly surrounded by yelling
Indians galloping madly to and fro, firing upon the
troops. So far, Reno had lost but one wounded and
the two who had galloped into the Indian line. His
second position was admirable for defense. Sheltered
by the trees, with his flanks and rear protected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the river, he could have held the place indefinitely.
However, he had not been detailed to defend or hold
any position, but to make a swift, dashing attack. Yet,
after a few moments of the feeblest kind of advance, he
found himself thrown on the defensive. Such a result
would break up the most promising plan. It certainly
broke up Custer’s. In spite of the defection of the
Rees, a vigorous countercharge down the valley would
have extricated Reno and might have saved Custer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a painful thing to accuse an army officer of misconduct;
yet I have taken the opinion of a number of
army officers on the subject, and every one of them considers
Reno culpable in a high degree. One at least has
not hesitated to make known his opinion in the most
public way. I am loath to believe that Major Reno was
a coward, but he certainly lost his head; and when he
lost his head, he lost Custer. His indecision was pitiful.
Although he had suffered practically no loss and had no
reason to be unduly alarmed, he was in a state of painful
uncertainty as to what he should do next. The soldier,
like the woman, who hesitates in an emergency
which demands instant decision, is lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long the troops stayed under the trees by the
river bank cannot be determined accurately. Some
have testified that it was a few moments, others an hour.
Personally I think it was a few moments, which fear and
apprehension lengthened to an impossible period. There
had as yet been no panic, and under a different officer
there would have been none; but it is on record that
Reno at last gave an order for the men to mount and
retreat to the bluffs. Before he could be obeyed, he
countermanded this order. Then the order was repeated,
but in such a way that nobody save those immediately
around him heard it, because of the din of the battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>then raging in a sort of aimless way all along the line, and
no attempt was made to obey it. It was then repeated
for the third time. Finally, as those farther away saw
those nearest the flurried commander mounting and
evidently preparing to leave, the orders were gradually
communicated throughout the battalion, and nearly the
whole mass got ready to leave. Eventually they broke
out of the timber in a disorderly column of fours, striving
to return to the ford which they had crossed when
they had entered the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reno calls this a charge, and he led it. He was so excited
that, after firing his pistols at the Indians who came
valiantly after the fleeing soldiers, he threw them away.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c007'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
The pressure of the Indians upon the right of the men
inclined them to the left, away from the ford. In fact, they
were swept into a confused mass and driven toward the
river. All semblance of organization was lost in the mad
rush for safety. The troops had degenerated into a mob.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians pressed closely upon them, firing into the
huddle almost without resistance. Evidently in their
excitement the Indians fired high, or the troops would
have been annihilated. The Indians supposed, of
course, that they now had the troops corralled between
them and the river, and that all they needed to do
was to drive them into it. Chief Gall, who with Crazy
Horse and Crow King was principally responsible for
the Indian manœuvers, seeing the retreat of Reno to the
river, summoned a large body of warriors, left the field
and crossed the river farther down, intending to sweep
down upon the other side and attack Reno’s men as they
struggled up the steep bank in case any of them succeeded
in crossing. This was, as it turned out, a fortunate
move for the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Meanwhile, Reno’s men providentially found a pony
trail which indicated a ford of the river. On the other
side the trail led into a funnel-shaped amphitheater,
surrounded by high, slippery bluffs. Into this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</span></i>
the whole fleeing body plunged, the Indians pressing
the rear hard. The men jumped their horses from the
bank into the water, and finding that the trail stopped at
the bluff on the other side, actually urged them up the
steep slopes of the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no denying that they were panic-stricken.
Although some of the veterans opened fire upon the savages,
the bulk of the troopers did nothing but run. Dr.
DeWolf was one of the coolest among those present. He
stopped his horse deliberately, and fired at the Indians
until he was shot dead. Lieutenant MacIntosh, striving
to rally his men, was shot just as they left the timber.
Lieutenant Hodgson, reaching the river bank, had his
horse shot. In his agony the animal stumbled into the
river and fell dead. The same bullet which killed
the horse broke Hodgson’s leg. He cried for help, and
Sergeant Criswell rode over to where he lay. Hodgson
took hold of the sergeant’s stirrup, and under a heavy
fire was dragged out on the bank, which he had scarcely
reached before a second bullet struck him in the head,
killing him instantly. Criswell was swept on by his
men, but so soon as he could he rode back under a furious
fire and brought off the body, as well as all the ammunition
in the saddle-bags on several dead horses. He
received a medal of honor for his courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Gall had completed his projected movements,
Reno’s men would have been annihilated then and there.
As it was, they reached the top of the bluffs without
further molestation. They had lost three officers and
twenty-nine men and scouts killed; seven men were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>badly wounded, and one officer, Lieutenant DeRudio,
and fifteen men were missing.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c007'><sup>[83]</sup></a> These had been left
behind in the confusion of Reno’s “charge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now somewhere between half after one and two
o’clock in the afternoon, and during the fighting Reno
was joined by Benteen’s battalion. The Indians kept
up a desultory fire on the position, but they seemed to
have diminished in numbers. Reno occupied the next
hour in reorganizing his force, getting the men into their
accustomed troops, and taking account of casualties.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. With Benteen’s Battalion</h4>

<p class='c020'>In accordance with his orders, Benteen had moved off
to the westward. He speedily became involved in almost
impassable country, full of deep ravines, in which
progress was slow and difficult. Water was very scarce
in the country over which the regiment had marched
until it reached the valley of the Big Horn. What water
they had found that morning was so alkaline that the
horses and mules, although they had been nearly a day
without water, would not drink it. The horses were
naturally tired, having marched over fifty miles since the
morning of the day before, and the terrible up-and-down
hill work exhausted them still more, although they were
by no means played out. No Indians were seen by Benteen,
and the condition of the country was such that it
was evident there were none before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to the right, therefore, and struck into the
valley of the Big Horn, just ahead of McDougall and
the pack train, intending to cross the river and attack
the village or join Reno, as the case might be. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>just watered his horses at a little brook following out a
morass, when a sergeant from Custer’s battalion passed
by on a gallop, with a message for the supply train to
come at once. As the trooper raced along the line he
shouted exultantly, “We’ve got ’em, boys!” Benteen’s
men took this to mean that Custer had captured the
village. A few moments after, Trumpeter Martini galloped
up with a message from Custer to Benteen, signed
by Cook, the adjutant, which read as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Benteen. Come on. Big village. Be quick. Bring
packs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“P. S. Bring packs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The need for the spare ammunition with the pack-train
was apparently so urgent that in his hurry Cook repeated
the last two words. At the same time the sound
of distant firing was heard in the valley. Making ready
for instant action, Benteen led his troopers forward at a
gallop down the valley. Tired though the animals were,
they responded nobly to the demands of their riders, and
the whole party swept across the hills in the direction
whence the trumpeter had come until they overlooked
the valley. Every one supposed that Custer had entered
the valley and was driving the Indians before him.
That he expected to have a big fight on his hands was
indicated by the reiteration of his request that the
pack-train should be rushed forward, evidently to bring
the reserve ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valley was filled with dust and smoke; the day
was frightfully hot and dry. Bodies of men could be
distinguished galloping up and down. Benteen would,
perhaps, have crossed the river and charged down the
valley had his attention not been called to a body of
men in blue on the bluff on the same side of the river to
the right. They were, assuredly, hotly engaged, but there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>were also evidences of fierce fighting far down the valley.
What was happening? What should he do? At this
junction one of the Crow scouts—these Indians had not
fled with the cowardly Rees, but remained with the command,
fighting bravely—came up driving a small bunch
of captured ponies, and he indicated that the principal
battle was on the bluff. Benteen accordingly galloped
around the bend of the river, and joined the demoralized
Reno without opposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is interesting to speculate what might have happened
if Benteen had crossed the river and had charged
down the valley. In that case, if Reno had recrossed
the river and again attacked, the day might still have
been won, but in all probability Reno would not have
recrossed and Benteen would have been annihilated.
At any rate, Benteen did the only thing possible when
Reno’s whereabouts and need were made known to him
by the scout.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reno had lost his hat in his famous “charge,” and had
his head tied up in a handkerchief. He was much excited,
and apparently had no idea as to what he should do
next. The officers of his battalion made no bones about
admitting to the newcomers that they had been badly
beaten and were in a critical condition. None of them
could tell anything about Custer.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The Battle on the Bluffs</h4>

<p class='c020'>Benteen’s men were ordered to divide their ammunition
with Reno’s. A line of skirmishers was thrown out
around the bluffs, and an effort to get water from the
river was made, the supply in the canteens having been
long ago exhausted. The Indian fire prevented this.
There was, of course, not a drop of water on the bluffs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and the wounded suffered greatly, to say nothing of the
thirsty men. The officers collected in groups on the
edge of the bluffs overlooking the field, and discussed
the question. They were not molested by the Indians
at this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general impression was that Custer had made the
mistake of his life in not taking the whole regiment in
together. Possibly Reno’s men took that view because
they had been so badly mauled themselves. The valley
had been filled with Indians, but, about three o’clock
or a little after, most of them galloped down the river
and were soon out of sight. The river banks were still
lined with Indians under cover, who kept up a smart fire
on Reno’s men if they attempted to descend the bluffs
and approach the water; but the main force had evidently
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Firing was heard far away to the northward. It was
heavy and continuous. There could be but one explanation
of it. Custer’s detachment had at last met the
Indians and was engaged. This should surely have
been a stimulus to Reno. Custer was fighting; Reno
was not menaced—what should he do? Later in the
afternoon two heavy volleys in rapid succession were
remarked. This was so unusual under the circumstances
that it was finally felt to be a signal from Custer. He
must surely be in grave peril, then, and calling for help.
How, in the name of all that was soldierly, could such
an appeal be neglected? Many and anxious were the
questions the officers and men put among themselves as
to why Reno did not do something. It was felt by everybody
that Custer was in grave jeopardy, and that Reno
should move at once. He had about three hundred
men under his command, one-half of whom had not
been engaged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Captain Weir, of D Troop, on the right of Reno’s command,
having cleared away the Indians in front of him,
at last boldly took matters in his own hands. After
pleading again and again for permission,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c007'><sup>[84]</sup></a> he started
alone without it toward the sound of the firing to see
what he could. Lieutenant Edgerly, his second, supposed
that he had received orders to advance, and he
accordingly put the troop in motion. Weir was on the
bluff, Edgerly lower down in a small ravine. The Indians
moved to attack Edgerly, when Weir signaled him
to lead his men up the bluff, which he did without loss.
The troop, unsupported and in defiance of Reno’s
orders, advanced to the point where Custer had been
last seen to wave his hat, and there stopped. The men
could overlook the ridges and valleys beyond them for a
great distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mile and a half or two miles away they could see,
through the defiles in the ridges, great clouds of mounted
Indians. Reports of rifles indicated that the battle,
whatever it was, was still being waged. It was impossible
for Weir and Edgerly to do anything with their
single troop. Although they were not seriously attacked
in their bold advance, Reno at first made no movement
to support them.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>At half after four Captain McDougall and the pack
train joined Reno. They had not been molested in any
way. At last, about five o’clock, Reno yielded to the
urgent and repeated representations of the angry officers,
and marched along the ridge to the position Weir and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Edgerly had reached. He came up to this point at half
after five. The firing on the bluffs far ahead was practically
over. The Indians could still be seen and some
shooting was going on, but there did not appear to be a
battle raging. They learned afterward that it was the
Indians shooting into the bodies of the dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident to every one that whatever might have
been done earlier in the afternoon, there was no use in
advancing now. Indeed, the Indians came sweeping
back in great force in front of Reno, and at once attacked
him. There was nothing for him to do but retreat to the
most defensible position he could find, and endeavor to
hold his ground. Custer and his men, if they still survived,
must be left to face as best they could whatever
fate had in store for them. Reno accordingly retreated
to the place on the bluff whence he had just come.
Lieutenant Godfrey, of K Troop, the rear guard, without
orders deployed and dismounted his men, and,
ably seconded by his junior, Lieutenant Luther R. Hare,
by hard fighting kept off the Indians till the retreat was
safely made by the rest, whom he and his troopers succeeded
in joining. It was well that he did this, for his
coolness and courage saved the command.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a little depression back of a ridge, which
afforded some cover for the horses and pack train. During
the retreat an incident occurred worthy of mention.
One of the pack mules, loaded with precious ammunition,
broke away and galloped toward the Indian line.
Sergeant Hanley, of C Troop, sprang to his horse and
raced after it. Officers and men called to him to come
back, but knowing how priceless was the ammunition,
he persisted in his course. He succeeded in heading
off the animal, which turned and ran parallel to the Indian
line, along which he galloped under a perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>shower of bullets, none of which, fortunately, touched
him. He captured the mule, and brought it back with the
ammunition intact. For this exploit he received a medal
of honor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men took position around the ridge, across the
depression and on a hill to the right, so as to protect
the packs and the field hospital from all sides except
on the river side, where the height of the bluffs and the
distance prevented any Indian attack from that direction.
Benteen’s Troop H was placed on the right. They
were on top of the break of the ridge and were without
cover, the ridges being entirely bare of trees. Farther
off, to the right, Benteen’s position was commanded by
higher ridges. At first the brunt of the fighting fell on
the left, but the Indians soon surrounded the position
and the engagement became general. The men threw
themselves on the ground, and dug rifle-pits with their
knives, tin pans—anything they could get. The fighting
soon became severe, but gradually slackened as darkness
approached, and stopped at about nine o’clock at
night. The village in the valley was the scene of triumphant
revel that night, and the shouting of the Indians
could plainly be heard on the bluffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early part of the night was full of wild confusion,
but before long the soldiers recovered their equanimity
and set to work strengthening their position. They
were now completely surrounded; but most of them were
under cover except Benteen’s men, whose position, as
has been stated, was overlooked by higher ridges within
easy range. At two <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, contrary to their usual habit,
the Indians opened fire, but no attack was made.
The next morning the battle began again in grim
earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians pressed the party closer and closer. Benteen’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>exposed line suffered more than any other position.
That experienced fighter saw that the Indians were
massing in front of him, evidently intending to deliver a
charge. If it fell upon his single troop it would not be
possible to withstand it, and the whole force on the hill
would be taken in reverse and annihilated. His men
had nearly exhausted their ammunition, several had
been killed, and there were a number of wounded to be
attended to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordering Lieutenant Gibson to hold the line at all
hazards, Benteen ran to Reno, explained the situation,
and begged for a reinforcement. After much urging
he succeeded in getting Troop M, Captain French, sent
over to the hill. Then he entreated Reno to allow the
two troops to charge. Reno hesitated. Benteen urged
him again and again, pointing out that if something were
not done immediately, the position would be rushed and
the command wiped out. At last he wrung a reluctant
permission from Reno. He ran back to his position on
the hill, and not a moment too soon formed his men up
for the charge, putting himself at their head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All ready now, men!” he cried gallantly. “Now’s
your time! Give ’em hell! Hip! Hip! Here we go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians had also given the word to charge, but
Benteen was too quick for them. Leading his men with
splendid bravery, revolver in hand, he rushed at the Indians.
There was a brief hand-to-hand mêlée and the
Indians broke and fled. Reno, seeing the effect of Benteen’s
gallant dash, actually led out a portion of his command
on the other side of the hill and drove back the Indians
in that direction. Benteen’s magnificent courage
had saved the day for the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire having slackened somewhat about eleven
o’clock in the morning, volunteers were called to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>water for the command, especially for the wounded.
The Indians swept the banks of the river with their fire,
and the attempt was hazardous to a degree. Nineteen
men offered their services. Four of the best marksmen—Geiger,
Windolph, Voit, and Mechling, of Troop
H—were detailed to cover the others by taking an exposed
position on the brink of the bluffs overlooking the
river, as near as they could get to it. The other fifteen,
one of whom has told me about the attempt, carrying
canteens and camp-kettles, but without arms, crawled
down through the bushes and ravines to the open space
on the bank of the river, and then, covered by the rapid
fire of the four men stationed above them, dashed for
the stream. The Indians, who were execrable shots,
opened a heavy fire upon them, but the men succeeded
in filling the vessels they had brought, and though many
of these vessels were hit and some of the men wounded,
none of them was killed. A scanty supply of water it
was, but it was a godsend. These nineteen also received
medals of honor.</p>

<p class='c000'>At three o’clock in the afternoon the firing, which
had been maintained intermittently since noon, finally
stopped, and later the men on the hill saw the Indians
withdrawing from the valley. They set fire to the grass
to screen their movements, but about seven o’clock in
the evening they were distinctly seen moving out with
all their possessions toward the mountains of the Big
Horn. Eighteen troopers had been killed on the hill,
and fifty-two wounded.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. The Last of Custer</h4>

<p class='c020'>Now let us turn to Custer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody knows exactly what he did. The testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of the field is not clear, and the statements of the Indians
are contradictory. Dr. Eastman, an educated Sioux,
has investigated the subject among many of his people,
and arrives at one conclusion; Colonel Godfrey, one
of the troop commanders who was with Benteen, and
who has subsequently examined the field in company
with Benteen and other officers, taking the testimony
of Chief Gall, holds another. According to Eastman,
whose account agrees with the popular understanding,
Custer attempted to ford the river at a place now called
Reno’s Creek,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c007'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and fall on what he supposed to be the
rear of the village, but which was really the middle of
the upper half, and was driven back to the hills, where
the final tragedy took place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Godfrey, on the contrary, says that Custer, from the
point where he was last seen by Reno’s men, had a view
of the village for several miles, although not for its whole
length; that he must have been confident that he had it
below him then, and that he made a wide detour in order
to fall on the rear of the village. It was from this
point that he sent the hurry-up message to Benteen.
When at last, having gone far enough, as he thought, to
take the village in the rear, or what he supposed was the
rear, he turned toward the river, and was at once met by
the Indians in great force.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was probably about half after two in the afternoon.
Reno had been forced back and driven across the river.
Chief Gall, it will be recalled, had taken a large body
of men across the river to intercept Reno on the other
side. Before he could move down to the right for this
purpose, Custer’s men suddenly appeared on the hills.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Custer’s manœuvering had been fine, and his appearance
was a complete surprise, which at first greatly
alarmed the Indians. Gall, however, did not lose his
head. Rightly judging that Reno was temporarily eliminated
from the game, he at once determined to attack
Custer. He sent word of the situation to Crazy Horse,
who was pressing Reno. Leaving just enough warriors
to make a demonstration before the demoralized Reno,
Crazy Horse galloped headlong down the valley, followed
by his men and joined by others from the far end
of the village, who had as yet taken no part in the
fighting. They too crossed the river at the point where
a deep ravine concealed their movements and enabled
them to obtain a position on Custer’s right flank. A
similar ravine enabled Gall to menace the left flank.
The Indians were in sufficient force completely to surround
Custer. In the twinkling of an eye he found himself
attacked in front and on both sides. Instead of advancing,
he was forced to defend himself against an overwhelming
attack. The troops were dismounted, horses
moved to the rear, and Custer’s men occupied the
ridges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Calhoun’s troop was posted on the left, followed by
those of Keogh, Smith, and Yates, with Tom Custer’s
on the extreme right. The last three troops happened
to have the best defensive position upon the highest hill.
With them was Custer. The Indians attacked at once.
Riding at full gallop along the front of the line on their
ponies, they poured a heavy fire from their long-range
rifles upon the soldiers, to which the latter made a brave,
steady, but not very effective reply with their inferior
carbines. Keogh’s and Calhoun’s horses were stampeded
at the first fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The force menacing them was so great that Custer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>dared not leave his position on the hills. To retreat was
hopeless, to advance impossible. They must stand on the
defensive and pray that the advance of Reno’s command
up the valley, which they probably hoped that Benteen
would reinforce, would compel the withdrawal of the
Indians from their front. They fought on, therefore,
coolly and resolutely, husbanding their ammunition and
endeavoring to make every shot tell on their galloping,
yelling foemen. They were, I imagine, by no means
without ultimate hope of victory. The Indians in their
accounts speak of the cool, deliberate courage of numbers
of the officers and men, whom they singled out for
their bravery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the troopers suffered great loss as the afternoon
wore on. Their ammunition began to run low, and the
contracting, whirling circle of Indians drove them closer
and closer together. The remaining horses of the other
three troops were at last stampeded, and with them
went all of the reserve ammunition. The situation had
evidently become so serious that Custer, in the vain
hope that Reno would understand his peril at last,
fired the two volleys which have been referred to. It
appears at this time that he must have endeavored to
send a message to Reno, for the body of a solitary
soldier, Sergeant Butler, was found after the battle at a
point half way between Custer’s and Reno’s commands.
A little heap of cartridges lay near his body, evidencing
that he had sold his life dearly. The Indians were
acute enough—so they say, and probably with truth—to
pick out the officers with Custer, and the mortality
among them was fearful. It was evident to all on the
hill, as the afternoon drew toward its close, that they
were doomed. It was hardly possible that a counterattack
by Reno would save them now, and there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>no evidences whatever that he was anywhere in the
vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where, in God’s name,” they must have asked
themselves in their despair, “can Reno be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the Crow scouts has said—although his account
is generally disbelieved—that he went at last to
Custer, as yet unharmed, and told him that he thought
he could get him away, and that Custer, of course,
refused to leave the field. The Crow altered his appearance
by draping a blanket about him so as to look
as much like a Sioux as possible, and in the confusion of
the fight got away safely.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c007'><sup>[86]</sup></a> He was the only human
survivor of the field.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c007'><sup>[87]</sup></a> What occurred after is a matter
of conjecture, based upon the contradictory and inadequate
testimony of the Indians themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gall and Crazy Horse now determined to end the affair.
Massing their warriors in the ravine, they fell on
both flanks at the same time that Crow King and Rain-in-the-Face
led a direct charge against the front of the
thinned and weakened line. They swept over the little
band of men, probably now out of ammunition, in a red
wave of destruction. There was a fierce hand-to-hand
struggle with clubbed guns, war-clubs, and tomahawks,
and all was over. Some twenty or thirty men, without
their officers, who had probably all been killed where
they stood, for their bodies were found grouped around
that of Custer on the highest hill, endeavored to break
through on the right. They were slaughtered to a man
before they reached the river. A few scattered bodies,
here and there in different parts of the field, indicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>that separate men had made futile dashes for freedom.
But the bulk of the command was found just where it had
fought, with <em>the troopers in line, their officers in position</em>!
They had been beaten and killed. Not an officer or man
lived to tell the story, but they had not been disgraced.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, the second day afterward, Terry, with Gibbon,
having relieved Reno’s men, found them on the hills
which they had immortalized by their desperate valor.
They had been stripped and most of them mutilated.
Custer’s body was shot in two places, in the side and in
the temple. It was not scalped or mutilated. Colonel
Dodge, an authority on Indian customs, declares that if
Custer’s body was neither scalped nor mutilated, he is
convinced that the general committed suicide. None
of the officers with whom I have communicated who
inspected the body is willing to indorse this statement;
on the contrary. Therefore, I am sure Colonel Dodge
must be in error. The Indians give no particular information
as to Custer’s death. All that is known is
that his body was there with those of his brave men.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Custer in that fight perished many gallant souls.
His brother, Captain Tom Custer, was the only man in
the United States Army who held two medals for capturing
two flags with his own hands in the Civil War.
Rain-in-the-Face had accomplished his terrible revenge,
for after the battle he had cut open the breast of the
brave young soldier and had eaten his heart. Calhoun,
of L Troop, was Custer’s brother-in-law. With him
was young Crittenden, a lieutenant of infantry, who had
sought an assignment with Custer for this campaign.
Smith was the captain of E, the Gray Horse Troop. At
the storming of Fort Fisher, after two color-bearers had
been killed, he had led his regiment to the attack, colors
in hand. His shoulder had been smashed by a musket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>ball in that attack. He could never afterward put
on his coat without assistance. With him was young
Sturgis. Yates, a veteran of the Civil War, was captain
of F, the Bandbox Troop; and with him was Riley, the
youngest lieutenant there. Keogh, of I Troop, the oldest
soldier of them all, and not the least brave, had been
an officer of the Papal Zouaves in early life. He had
a gallant record in the Civil War, too. With him was
Porter, and with the others who had done their parts
were Cook, the adjutant, and Lord, the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others worthy of note fell on that fatal field: Mark
Kellogg, a newspaper correspondent; Charlie Reynolds,
the famous scout; Boston Custer, the General’s brother,
who was civilian forage-master of the regiment, and
Autie Reed, the General’s nephew—a mere boy, who
wanted to see something of life in the West and who
had welcomed with joy his opportunity to make the campaign.
Well, he saw it, poor fellow! Indeed, the Custer
family was almost wiped out on that fatal Sunday.</p>

<p class='c000'>Premonitions of disaster, such as loving women may
feel, were in the air that afternoon. Back at Fort Abraham
Lincoln, the devoted wife tells how the women of
the garrison assembled in her quarters in an agony of
apprehension. There were words of prayer. Some
one at the piano started “Nearer My God to Thee,” and
the women tried to sing it, but they could not finish it.
It was not until the 5th of July that they received the
news that at that very hour their loved ones were dying
on the hill.</p>

    <div>OFFICERS OF THE SEVENTH CAVALRY</div>
    <div class='c004'>All killed at the Little Big Horn</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>V. After the Battle</h4>

<p class='c020'>On the morning of the 27th of June Terry and Gibbon
rescued Reno. The next day the surviving troops
of the regiment, with some individuals from the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>command, marched to the scene of Custer’s defeat to
identify and bury the dead. The bodies upon the dry
grass had all been stripped and left, white and ghastly
save for the red stains of wounds. The bodies of
Doctor Lord, Lieutenants Porter, Harrington, and
Sturgis, with those of a number of men, were not recovered.
What became of them is not known to this
day. They may have been captured alive and taken by
the Indians to the village, and there tortured to death
and their bodies disposed of. This, however, is unlikely.
The Indians positively deny that they took any
prisoners, and it is probable that they did not. There
are quicksands near the bed of the Little Big Horn, and
possibly those bodies were engulfed in them. But all
this is only surmise. No one can tell anything about it,
except that they were undeniably killed. And we may
be certain they died as brave men should.</p>

<p class='c000'>They buried two hundred and twelve bodies on the
hill, and the total losses of the regiment in the two days of
fighting were two hundred and sixty-five killed and fifty-two
wounded—over fifty per cent. The losses of the
Indians were never ascertained. They did not, however,
begin to equal those of the soldiers. It is grossly unfair
to speak of the battle as the “Custer Massacre,” as
is often done. Custer attacked the Indians, and they
fought him until all the white men were killed. There
was no massacre about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cause of the disaster must, first of all, be laid to
Custer’s disobedience of orders. In spite of that, however,
I think it is probable that he might have won the
battle, or at least made good his defense until relieved by
Terry and Gibbon, although sustaining heavy loss, had
it not been for three happenings. The first was the
vastly greater number of Indians in the field than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>one expected to encounter. The next, and to me this is
absolutely decisive, was Reno’s failure to press his attack.
If he had gone in with the dashing gallantry
which was expected of him, while it is certain that he
could not alone have whipped the Indians, yet he could
have so disorganized them as to have maintained his position
in the valley in the midst of the village without the
greatest difficulty, until Custer could fall upon the rear
of those attacking him, and Benteen, with the pack train,
could reinforce them both. The Indians say that they
were demoralized for the time being by Reno’s sudden
appearance, and that the squaws were packing up getting
ready for flight when the weakness of Reno’s advance
encouraged them to try to overwhelm him. Custer
had a right to expect that Reno would do his duty as
a soldier and take a bold course—which was, as usual,
the only safe course.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Godfrey, in his account, suggests still a third
cause. The carbines of the troopers did not work well.
When they became clogged and dirty from rapid firing,
the ejectors would not throw out the shells, and the men
frequently had to stop and pick out the shells with a
knife. The chambers of the carbines at that time were
cylindrical, and the easily accumulated dirt on the cartridges
clogged them so that the ejectors would not
work properly. The chambers were afterward made
conical, with good results. The Indians had no such
trouble. Their weapons were newer and better than
those of the soldiers. If the indifferent weapons of the
troopers failed them, their annihilation in any event
would have been certain.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c007'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>I have censured Custer somewhat severely in this article,
and it is a pleasure to me to close it with a quotation
from Captain Whittaker’s life of his old commander.
In this quotation Lawrence Barrett, the eminent actor,
who was an old and intimate friend of Custer, has summarized
the character of the brave captain in exquisitely
apposite language; and, in his words, I say good-by to the
gallant soldier whose errors were atoned for by an heroic
death in the high places of the field:</p>

<p class='c000'>“His career may be thus briefly given: He was born
in obscurity; he rose to eminence; denied social advantages
in his youth, his untiring industry supplied them;
the obstacles to his advancement became the steppingstones
to his fortunes; free to choose for good or evil,
he chose rightly; truth was his striking characteristic&nbsp;...
his acts found his severest critic in his own
breast; he was a good son, a good brother, a good and
affectionate husband, a Christian soldier, a steadfast
friend. Entering the army a cadet in early youth, he became
a general while still on the threshold of manhood;
with ability undenied, with valor proved on many a
hard-fought field, he acquired the affection of the nation;
and he died in action at the age of thirty-seven, died as
he would have wished to die, no lingering disease preying
upon that iron frame. At the head of his command,
the messenger of death awaited him; from the field of
battle where he had so often ‘directed the storm,’ his
gallant spirit took its flight. Cut off from aid, abandoned
in the midst of incredible odds ... the
noble Custer fell, bequeathing to the nation his sword;
to his comrades an example; to his friends a memory,
and to his beloved a Hero’s name.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Mr. Theodore W. Goldin, of Janesville,
Wisconsin, formerly a trooper of the
Seventh Cavalry, now Chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee of Wisconsin,
was the last, or perhaps the next to the last, man
to see Custer alive. He has prepared an account of his
personal experiences in the battle, which is one of
the most interesting of the contributions that have
been made to this volume. His description of the
death of Hodgson is splendidly dramatic, as is his story
of the brief conversations between Custer and Keogh,
Reno and Weir, and Benteen and Wallace.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a magnificent picture is that presented by Hodgson,
determined to retreat no longer, facing about,
drawing his revolver, and dying at last, face to the foe,
weapon in hand! Mr. Goldin contradicts the popular
impression, as repeated by Colonel Godfrey and others,
that Reno threw away his pistols in his “charge.”</p>

<p class='c022'>In reply to your request, I will say that I had known
Gen. Custer from the time I joined the regiment in
1873 up to the time of his tragic death, and had campaigned
with him and with the regiment with the exception
of the year 1875, when the troop to which I was
attached was stationed in the South.</p>

<p class='c022'>Early in the spring of ’76, we received word that an
expedition was being organized against the Sioux, and
that three large columns were to take the field, and a few
weeks later our marching orders came, and our battalion
changed station from near Shreveport, La., to Fort Lincoln,
D. T.</p>

<p class='c022'>At the time of our arrival Gen. Custer was in
Washington before some investigating committee, and
only joined the regiment a few days before our column
took the field, he having been ordered under arrest at
Chicago while en-route from Washington.</p>

<p class='c022'>I will not take the time or space to touch on our march
from Fort Lincoln to the Yellowstone, which we struck
near the mouth of the Powder River. Here we remained
a few days while outfitting our pack train, as
it had been determined that we would abandon our
wagons here and establish a supply camp. Maj. Reno
had left us a few days before on a scout, expecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>to rejoin us near the mouth of the Tongue River on
June 17th.</p>

<p class='c022'>After arranging to leave our wagon train and some
dismounted recruits and the regimental band at the
Powder River, we moved camp to the mouth of the
Tongue, where we lay on the 17th of June, the day on
which Gen. Crook had his big fight with the Indians
on the Rosebud. During the day we watched every
distant dust cloud that whirled across the river bottom,
hoping that it meant the approach of Maj. Reno’s
command, but as nothing was heard from him, we
broke camp on the morning of the 18th and moved up
the valley, where we effected a junction with Reno soon
after noon. During the previous days we could not
help but note the fact that Gen. Custer seemed moody
and discontented, and, entirely different from his usual
habit, appeared nervous and excited to some extent.</p>

<p class='c022'>When Reno came in with his report he became a
changed man. His old-time energy and snap were made
apparent by the manner in which he hustled the command
into marching order and took the trail for the
Rosebud, where Gen. Terry on our supply steamer
the “Far West” had already preceded us in the hope
of striking the command of Gen. Gibbon, who was
known to be somewhere in that vicinity. Our march
was prolonged far into the night, but we finally struck
the Yellowstone and went into camp, assured that if the
steamer was below us we were bound to intercept it.</p>

<p class='c022'>The following morning we were in the saddle early,
and soon after noon we sighted the wagon train of
Gen. Gibbon’s command moving slowly up the river
and a few moments later the “Far West” steamed
into sight. Couriers were sent out to advise them of
the fact that Reno had discovered the trail of a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>body of Indians, and in a short time we were in
camp near the mouth of the Rosebud and a council
of war was held at which we understood that Reno’s
report was discussed in detail.</p>

<p class='c022'>The following day arrangements were made for a vigorous
campaign. A final council was held on the
steamer on the night of the 21st, as I now recollect it,
at which time Gen. Custer received his final orders,
substantially as you have stated them. At this council,
and just about the time it was breaking up, the question
was asked Gen. Gibbon as to what time he could
reach the mouth of the Little Big Horn River, and he
replied,</p>

<p class='c022'>“Not before noon of the 26th.”</p>

<p class='c022'>At this conference it was reported that Custer had
been offered the battalion of the Second Cavalry and
the artillery which had been brought up on the steamer,
but declined both, claiming that he knew his command
so well that he preferred to trust himself with them
alone, and that he feared the artillery might delay his
march when nearly in presence of the enemy. Many
of the officers and men felt that it was but a part of a
preconceived scheme to secure an independent command,
such as he had been used to having for years,
but be that as it may his request was granted.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the afternoon of June 22d we passed in review
before Gen. Terry and Gen. Gibbon, and soon struck
the trail described by Maj. Reno. From that time
until Reno struck the Indian village we did not
deviate from it except when it became necessary to
find a satisfactory camping ground. No attempt was
made to scout the country as we had been directed to
do, nor was any attempt made to send a courier across
to Gen. Gibbon, although a man named Herndon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>a scout, had been attached to our command for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c022'>Our marches were long and our movements very
rapid until the night of the 24th, when we moved off the
trail some distance and apparently settled down for the
night. But this was only a ruse to mislead the Indians,
as we had received orders not to unpack our saddles and
to be prepared for a night march.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the hour we left the Rosebud Gen. Custer
acted in many respects like another man, his old-time
restless energy had returned, and he seemed to think of
nothing but to reach and strike the Indians. In this
connection it might be well to say that the trail we were
following led from the direction of the Missouri River
and indicated, according to the estimate of Bloody Knife
and some of our Crow scouts, a band of from a thousand
to twelve hundred Indians, whom we afterward learned
came from the Missouri River agencies and consisted
almost entirely of warriors.</p>

<p class='c022'>About eleven o’clock we received word to saddle up
and lead into line. In the meantime a scouting party of
Crows and Rees, with some of our officers, Lieut.
Varnum and, I think, Lieut. Hare, had pushed on
ahead of us to scout the trail across the divide and seek
to locate the Indians if possible. Leaving our bivouac,
we again struck the trail and pushed forward, seeking
to cross the divide and get into the shelter of the foot-hills
along the Little Big Horn before daybreak the following
morning. Owing to the roughness of the country
and the difficulty in scouting the trail, we were unable
to do this, and daybreak found us in a ravine at the
foot of a range of high bluffs, just how far from the river
we did not know.</p>

<p class='c022'>Some time during the night it was said Gen. Custer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>had pushed ahead and joined the scouts, and that
just after daybreak they told him they had located
the village in the valley of the Little Big Horn, but
Gen. Custer replied that he did not believe them. In
the meantime it became apparent that our presence in
the country was known, as, during the night a box of
ammunition<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c007'><sup>[92]</sup></a> had been lost and a detachment sent back
to recover it came across some Indians trying to open
the box. On this being reported to Gen. Custer, he
seemed to decide on an immediate advance.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the talk, just about the time the division was made
in the command, Mitch Bowyer, a half-breed Crow
interpreter, said to Gen. Custer that he would find
more Indians in that valley than he could handle with
his command. Custer replied that if he (Bowyer) was
afraid to go he could stay behind. Bowyer replied that
he was not afraid to go wherever Custer did, or something
to that effect, but that if they went in there neither
of them would come out alive.</p>

<p class='c022'>Just before the advance was made I was detailed by
Lieut. McIntosh to report to Gen. Custer for duty as
orderly, and at once did so. The general directed
me to ride with Lieut. Cook, our regimental adjutant,
and perform any duties he might assign to me.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>During our brief halt the men had thrown themselves
on the ground and were most of them asleep, while the
horses were grazing among the sage brush. Gen. Custer
ordered the advance, saying that the company in
each battalion first ready should have the right of the
line, and in a few minutes we were all in the saddle.
During the halt it had been ordered that Benteen with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>his battalion should move off to the left, scouting the
country in that direction, driving before him any Indians
he might discover, and sending word to the command
of anything he might find. Reno was to follow the
trail, while Gen. Custer with the five troops under
him struck off to the right, leaving McDougall with the
pack train to follow as best he could.</p>

<p class='c022'>We immediately took up the line of march in accordance
with these orders, and after probably a half hour’s
hard ride the impassibility of some of the hills and ravines
forced the column under Gen. Custer to veer
off to the left and we soon came up with the command
of Maj. Reno, which was pushing ahead on the trail
as fast as the roughness of the ascent would permit.
After a hard climb we reached the top of the ridge,
where we saw before us a rolling plateau sloping off
toward the foot-hills of the river, which was perhaps
some five or six miles away.</p>

<p class='c022'>As our command dashed over the divide we could
see Reno some distance in front of us, moving rapidly
down the trail, while several miles to our left was the
command of Col. Benteen, scouting the bluffs as he
had been ordered. For some distance we followed the
general course of Reno’s advance, but were some distance
in his rear and to his right.</p>

<p class='c022'>To those of us who were near him it seemed that Custer
was chafing at the apparent slowness of our advance,
as he would at times dash ahead of the column and
then rein in and await our approach and again off he
would go. Just about this time we discovered a huge
dust cloud moving down the river valley, but could not
determine the nature of it. As soon as this was discovered
Custer rode over toward the river accompanied
only by his orderly trumpeter, and stopped for a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>on the top of a high pinnacle, where we saw him
wave his hat, apparently in salutation to some one in
the distance, and then come dashing back toward the
head of the column which was headed by Capt.
Keogh and “I” Troop, veterans of a dozen fights.
With his eyes snapping in his excitement, Custer rode
up to Keogh and said, somewhat excitedly:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Keogh, those Indians are running. If we can keep
them at it we can afford to sacrifice half the horses in
the command.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Calmly as though on dress parade, Keogh turned in
his saddle and looked back at the long line of eager,
bronzed, bearded faces, and turned to Custer with the
remark:</p>

<p class='c022'>“General, we will do all that man and horse can do.”</p>

<p class='c022'>A moment later the bugles blared out the charge, the
first bugle note we had heard since leaving the Rosebud,
and away we thundered northward down the river, two
or three times seeking to find a place where we could
work down into the valley below us, but without success.</p>

<p class='c022'>After perhaps the third unsuccessful trial, Gen. Custer
talked hurriedly with Capt. Cook for a moment, and
Cook pulled out his pad and dashed off a line or two,
which he folded up, at the same time calling for an
orderly. I happened to be the first one to reach him,
and he handed me the paper with the order.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Deliver that to Maj. Reno, remain with him until
we effect a junction, then report to me at once,” and he
was gone.</p>

<p class='c022'>An instant later the rear of the column dashed past
me and was lost to sight in the ravines. For an instant
I looked after them, and then realizing that I was in a
dangerous country and alone, I lost no time in heading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>in the direction of Reno’s command, which I was able
to locate by the dust cloud that hovered over them.
Fortunately, I was not molested to any great extent. A
few long-range shots were fired at me, which only served
to accelerate my speed and materially added to my desire
to be among friends.</p>

<p class='c022'>A ride of some five or six miles and I overtook Reno
just as he was dismounting to fight on foot. I delivered
my dispatch, the contents of which I did not know.
Reno glanced at it somewhat hurriedly and stuck it in
his pocket. About this time the Ree scouts stampeded
and, as we afterward learned, did not recover their sand
until they reached the Powder River and the shelter
of the wagon train. It soon became apparent that the
Indians were passing our flank and coming in behind
us, and we were forced to face about and endeavor to
repel their advances until we could get our horses into
the timber, in which attempt several horses were shot
and two or three stampeded. Soon after this we retired
into the timber, where we had better protection
and resumed the fight. Sheltered by the timber and
the river bank, we were able to make a much better
defense for a short time.</p>

<p class='c022'>Soon after this we noticed that Capt. Moylan was
mounting his troop and Lieut. Wallace, who stood near
me on the skirmish line, called to Capt. French, who was
commanding the center company, and asked what the
orders were. French replied that he hadn’t received
any but would try and find out, and in a few minutes he
called to us saying he understood they were going to
charge, that he had not received any orders, but we
might as well mount and support them.</p>

<p class='c022'>We were ordered to get to our horses, and while doing
this we found that some fifteen of our men were dismounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>either because of the shooting or stampeding
of their horses. Lieut. McIntosh had lost his horse
and took one belonging to a trooper named McCormick,
who gave him up with the remark that we were all
dead anyway, and he might as well die dismounted as
mounted. Swinging into the saddle, we moved out of
the timber and to our surprise discovered that instead of
“charging the Indians” Reno was executing a masterly
charge on the bluffs on the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p class='c022'>As soon as the Indians discovered this, they massed on
our flanks and opened a heavy fire on the retreating
column. Fortunately, they were poor marksmen mounted,
and our loss was comparatively small at this stage
of the stampede, for that is what it was.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is reported that Reno became so excited that he
emptied his revolver at the Indians and then threw the
weapon from him. I happen to know this was not so, as
the revolver is now in the possession of Gen. Benteen
or his family, or was a few years ago.</p>

<p class='c022'>During the progress of this retreat I was riding on the
left of our column and near the timber, and when almost
in sight of the river my horse fell, throwing me into
a bunch of sage brush, but without doing me serious injury
save to exterior cuticle. As I scrambled to my feet
Lieut. Wallace passed me, shouting for me to run for
the timber as my horse was killed. I did not stop to
verify his report, but took his advice, striking only one or
two high places between where the horse fell and the
timber, which I presently reached.</p>

<p class='c022'>From where I was concealed I could see our men
force their horses into the river and urge them across the
boulder-strewn stream. I saw Lieut. Hodgson’s horse
leap into the stream and saw him struggling as though
wounded, I saw the lieutenant disengage himself from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>the stirrups and grab the stirrup strap of a passing
trooper and with that aid make his way across the
stream. No sooner had he reached the bank than it
became apparent he had been wounded, but he pluckily
held on, and the trooper seemed to be trying to help
him up behind him on the saddle, but without daring
to stop his horse. An instant later Hodgson seemed
to be hit again, for he lost his hold, fell to the ground,
staggered to his feet and sought to reach another comrade
who reined in to aid him, and just as it seemed that
he was saved I saw the second trooper throw up his arms,
reel in the saddle and fall heavily to the ground. Hodgson
started to make his way toward the ravine up which
the command was disappearing, he staggered forward
a few steps, stumbled, struggled to his feet again, only
to fall once more. He apparently decided that further
effort to retreat was useless, as I saw him turn and face
the Indians, draw his revolver and open fire. An instant
later three or four shots rang out from my side of
the river, and I saw Hodgson reel and fall and I knew it
was all over.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the meantime our men had succeeded in crossing
the river and made their way up a neighboring ravine,
all save those who had met their fate at the ford, which
was one of the worst along the river for many rods.
Left alone, I began to wonder what my own fate was
likely to be, but I was not observed and therefore not
molested, the Indians being busy stripping and mutilating
the bodies of our dead along the banks of the stream.</p>

<p class='c022'>About this time I could hear sounds of heavy firing
down the river, and made up my mind that Custer was
engaging the Indians, and from the momentary glimpses
I had of the village I felt that he was as badly outnumbered
as we were. Most of the Indians in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>front melted away and I could see them lashing their
ponies as they hurried to join their friends at the lower
end of the village.</p>

<p class='c022'>About this time I saw the scout, Herndon, some little
distance from me, making his way toward the river, and
called to him, and we were soon together. He told me
that the fifteen dismounted men of our outfit had made
their way to a point in the timber about a couple of hundred
yards from where we were, but that in order to get
nearer the river they had to cross an open space and
every time they tried it the Indians fired on them. Before
leaving us the Indians had set the river bottom on
fire, evidently with a design of concealing their movements,
or of smoking or roasting out our wounded.
This smoke proved to be our salvation, as under its
cover we made our way to the river, forded it with some
difficulty, and stumbled on to one of our Crow scouts,
who pointed out to us the location of the command,
which we soon joined.</p>

<p class='c022'>We found that Benteen and his battalion had reached
it and that nothing was known of the location of Custer
and his command. We reported what we had heard and
seen, and just about this time some one discovered a
white flag waving from a point in the river bottom near
where Herndon and myself had been concealed. Lieut.
Hare, at the risk of his life, crept down to a point of bluffs
overlooking the valley, and after considerable signaling
satisfied the party we were friends and they made their
way across the river and soon joined us, proving to be
the dismounted men who had been left to their fate
when Reno made his retreat.</p>

<p class='c022'>I omitted to state that when we started on our retreat
Lieut. McIntosh, mounted on McCormick’s horse, was
several rods in front of me and I noticed that in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>way his lariat had become loosened and was dragging on
the ground, the picket pin striking sage brush and other
obstacles, and rendering his immediate vicinity very
dangerous. Several of the men sought to call his attention
to it, but evidently he did not hear them. A moment
after this I saw his horse go down, but whether
he was shot or not I do not know. All I could see as I
passed was that the lieutenant was lying where he fell,
and was either dead or stunned, probably dead, as we
found him in the same place the day after the Indians
left us.</p>

<p class='c022'>As we were standing on the bluffs looking down into
the valley I heard some loud talk near me, and turning
in that direction, I heard Capt. Weir say:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Well, by G—d, if you won’t go, I will, and if we ever
live to get out of here some one will suffer for this.”</p>

<p class='c022'>He strode away, and a few moments later I saw “D”
Troop mount up and move down the valley in the direction
of the distant firing. Apparently without orders,
the entire command followed them in no sort of military
order with the exception of the two troops under Benteen
and Godfrey. In this way we pushed down the
valley some distance, when we discovered Weir and his
troop falling back before a largely superior body of
Indians.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hastily forming a line, we held back the advancing
horde until Weir and his command had passed our lines
and formed some distance in our rear, where, with the
support of some of our men who were near them, they
formed a line and opened fire, permitting us to fall back
and re-form again in their rear. In this way we fell back
some little distance, when Col. Benteen, who seemed to
be the leader in our section of the field, spoke to Lieut.
Wallace, saying:</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Wallace, there is no use falling back any further.
Form your troop, your right resting here, and we will
make a stand.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Wallace grinned and said,</p>

<p class='c022'>“I haven’t any troop, only two men.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Benteen laughed grimly and answered,</p>

<p class='c022'>“Form yourself and your two there, and I will tell you
more about it when I find out myself.”</p>

<p class='c022'>That was the nucleus of our line of defense. Others
soon joined us and we sheltered ourselves behind sage
brush and hurriedly heaped piles of dirt and opened fire,
keeping the Indians at a respectable distance until darkness
came to our relief. During the night we changed
our position a trifle, located our corral and hospital,
and put in the night intrenching ourselves as best we
could. At daybreak the fight opened again and continued
without intermission until about three in the
afternoon, when to our surprise the Indians began
to take down their tepees, pack their travois, and in a
few hours were moving up the river valley, a great mass
of ponies, travois and Indians, unfortunately just out of
rifle range.</p>

<p class='c022'>Twice during the afternoon volunteer parties had
gone for water, each time being fired upon by the Indians,
but it was only on the second trip that any one
was hit. Poor Madden, of “K” Troop, was the unfortunate,
his leg being shattered three times between
the ankle and the knee. We carried him back to the
hospital, where his leg was amputated that night.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the following day Gen. Terry and Gen. Gibbon
came to our relief, and through them we received
the first authentic information as to the fate of our
comrades of the other battalion. On the 28th, after
having transported our wounded across the river,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>we visited the scene of the battle and buried such of
Custer’s men as we found. Aside from General Custer,
we found hardly a body on the field that had not been
mutilated in some manner or another, but as I recollect
now, we found no marks of mutilation on our dead
leader.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the space at my disposal it is not possible to deal
in incidents of the fight or go into detailed descriptions.
In fact, those have been well covered in your article
already.</p>

<p class='c022'>Since the fight I have discussed it with many officers
of the army, and others who have had experience on the
frontier, and the general opinion seemed to be that there
were two, possibly three, main causes for this disaster.</p>

<p class='c022'>First: A division of the command into practically
four separate columns while still some fifteen miles from
the battle-field, and without accurate knowledge as to the
exact location or approximate strength of the enemy,
and the separation of those columns so that at a critical
period of the fight no two of them were in supporting
distance of one another.</p>

<p class='c022'>Second: The fact that Custer came into the presence
of the enemy practically twenty-four hours ahead
of time.</p>

<p class='c022'>Third: The loss of the horses and with them much
of the surplus ammunition of Custer’s command.</p>

<p class='c022'>This subject has been so often discussed by men much
abler than myself that I will not attempt it here.</p>

<p class='c022'>My experiences with Gen. Custer always led me to
look upon him as somewhat recklessly brave, disposed
to take chances without fully considering the odds
against him.</p>

<p class='c022'>I have always felt that one possible reason for the
course he followed, in the face of the orders he received,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>might be attributed to the fact that he was feeling keenly
the apparent disgrace of the treatment accorded him by
the President, and that he thought that by a brilliant
dash and a decided victory, similar to his Washita fight,
he might redeem himself and once more stand before
the people as a leader and an Indian fighter second to
none. Whatever may have been his motive, we must all
admit that he made a most gallant fight and gave his life
at the side of the comrades who had ridden with him to
victory in many a previous battle.</p>

is the following account of the Battle of the Little Big

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The writer saw much of the “Custer Indians”
at the World’s Fair and afterward at Coney
Island, and had a good chance to know some
of them well. The following leaves from a
diary kept at that time show how the Indians regarded
the Custer fight; they considered that the white men
were simply outgeneraled by Sitting Bull:</p>

<p class='c022'>Rain-in-the-Face (Itiomagaju) hobbled into the tent
to-night, as McFadden and I were discussing the events
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of the day, and seating himself, unbidden, with true Indian
stoicism, he grunted out that one word of all words
so dear to a Lakota, “Minnewaukan!” which, literally
translated, means “Water of God,” but which by usage
has been interpreted as “fire-water.” Since the other
Indians were all away from camp on a visit to their
friends, the Oglalas at Buffalo Bill’s camp, I decided to
yield for once to Rain’s oft-repeated demand, which had
been hitherto as regularly denied.</p>

<p class='c022'>He took my flask, and with a guttural “How!” drained
it at one gulp, without straining a muscle of his face.
“Ugh! good! like Rain’s heart,” he remarked, as he
handed the empty bottle to “Mac” with a self-satisfied
look. Then, after a long pause, he joined in our hearty
laughter, and added: “Wechasa Chischina (Little Man,
as he always calls me) good! Potoshasha (Red Beard,
his name for McFadden) good! Minnewaukan good!
All heap good!”</p>

<p class='c022'>“Something’s come over the old man,” laughed Mac.
“His heart’s good to-night. Suppose we take advantage
of it, as the boys are all over at the Oglala tepees,
and get Rain to turn his heart inside out. Here, give me
my hat and I’ll get the flask refilled and bring back
Harry with me to interpret.” Off he went like a shot,
leaving me to entertain Rain as best I could with my
small knowledge of the Sioux lingo and signs.</p>

<p class='c022'>McFadden soon returned, bringing Harry McLaughlin,
our interpreter. It didn’t take long to get Rain
started; after he had had another pull at the flask, he
said:</p>

<p>RAIN-IN-THE-FACE<br /><br /><em>From a sketch from life made in 1894 by Edward Esmonde</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“If you want a story, I will tell a true one. It’s about
myself. I was a bad man and dangerous to fool with
before I had to walk with crutches. My heart’s good
now, but it was all the time bad when I was a fighter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>a hunter. The maidens admired me, but the bucks
were afraid of me. I would rather fight than eat. The
long swords (soldiers) trembled when they knew I was
near, and the Rees and Crows always felt of their hair
every morning to see if their scalps were still on when
Rain was near by.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Here Harry headed him off, for it’s natural for an Indian
to boast, and if any one will listen he will sing his
own praises for hours at a stretch.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Yes, we know you were a bad man and a fighter
from ’way back,” said Harry, “but we want to hear
about the time Tom Custer made you take water. If
you were such a brave man, how did it happen that a
little man like Tom Custer got the best of you?”</p>

<p class='c022'>This had the desired effect, and Rain winced under
such a reflection on his bravery, for he measured forty-six
inches around his chest, stood five feet nine inches,
and weighed about 195 pounds at that time, while
Captain Tom Custer was under the average weight and
height.</p>

<p class='c022'>With great deliberation and much gesticulation, Rain
told his version of the incident in question, and much to
our surprise he continued on and related his version of
the “Custer Massacre.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Now, since nearly all the officers in the Regular Army,
as well as all the agents of the Interior Department, have
failed to get him even to speak of this fight (their trying,
coaxing, and threatening for years has been in vain), and
since Rain gets the credit of being the slayer of Custer,
and has been immortalized in verse by Longfellow, it was
a pleasant surprise to have this unexpected revelation.
I am writing it down as nearly like McLaughlin interpreted
it as I can.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Two years before the big fight,” he said, “Gall and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Sitting Bull had their camp at Standing Rock. All were
hostiles. They were Unkpapa Sioux and fighters who
never feared an enemy any more than a buffalo calf. The
Yanktonais (friendly Indians) were coffee coolers (cowards)
and hung around the agency which was at Lincoln
then (Fort Abraham Lincoln on the upper Missouri
now). We used to have great times in the hostile camp,
dancing, running races, shooting and playing games.
Buffalo and deer were plenty, and we had many ponies.
I was a great fellow with the girls. They used to tease
me to get me mad—when I got mad I knew no reason,
I wanted to fight. One night a girl dared me to go up to
Fort Lincoln and kill a white man. I told her it was too
risky, as the long swords always kept watch. Besides,
the Rees (another tribe of Indians, employed by the government
as scouts) had their lodges on the hill back of
the fort. The wood-choppers were camped between the
fort and the river. She said:</p>

<p class='c022'>“’A brave man fears nothing. If you are a coward,
don’t go. I’ll ask some other young man who isn’t
afraid, if he hasn’t danced in the Sun Dance.’ (This
was a torture dance in which Rain-in-the-Face subsequently
underwent the most horrible self-torture ever
inflicted.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c007'><sup>[93]</sup></a>)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“The other girls laughed, but the young men who
heard it didn’t. They feared me. I would have killed
them for laughing. I went to my lodge and painted
sapa (black, the color used when they go on the war-path),
took my gun, my bow, my pony. Sitting Bull
had forbidden any one to leave camp without his permission.
I skipped off under cover of darkness and went up
to Lincoln (forty-five miles north, opposite the present
site of Bismarck, North Dakota). I hung around for
two days, watching for a chance to shoot a long sword.
I had plenty of chances to kill a Ree squaw, plenty to
kill a wood-chopper, but I wanted to carry back the
brass buttons of a long sword to the girl who laughed at
me. I did so, and she sewed them on her shawl. One
morning I saw the sutler (store keeper) and a horse medicine
man (U. S. Veterinary Surgeon Hontzinger) go out
to a spring; Long Yellow Hair (General Custer) and his
men were riding back about 100 yards. I rushed up
and shot the sutler and brained the horse medicine man
with my war club; then I shot them full of arrows and
cut off some buttons. Long Yellow Hair heard the shot
and his troop charged back. I didn’t have time to scalp
the men I got. I jumped on my pony and yelled at them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>to catch me. They chased me to the Cannon Ball (a
small river twenty-five miles south). Charlie Reynolds
(a scout) knew me and told Long Yellow Hair who did
this brave deed.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Next winter I went to the agency store at Standing
Rock. I drew no rations—I hadn’t signed the paper.
(All the Indians who signed a peace treaty and consented
to live on the reservation, under military orders,
were furnished with rations by the government twice a
month. The hostiles had to live by hunting.) Istokscha
(One Arm, the Hon. H. S. Parkin) was running the
store then. I wasn’t afraid of any of them. Little Hair
(Capt. Tom Custer) had thirty long swords there. He
slipped up behind me like a squaw, when my back was
turned. They all piled on me at once; they threw me
in a sick wagon (ambulance) and held me down till they
got me to the guard-room at Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c022'>“I was treated like a squaw, not a chief. They put me
in a room, chained me, gave me only one blanket. The
snow blew through the cracks and on to me all winter.
It was cold. Once Little Hair let me out and the long
swords told me to run. I knew they wanted to shoot me
in the back. I told Little Hair that I would get away
some time; I wasn’t ready then; when I did, I would
cut his heart out and eat it. I was chained to a white
man. One night we got away. They fired at us, but
we ran and hid on the bank of Hart river in the brush.
The white man cut the chains with a knife (a file). They
caught him next day.</p>

<p class='c022'>“I rejoined Sitting Bull and Gall. They were afraid to
come and get me there. I sent Little Hair a picture, on
a piece of buffalo skin, of a bloody heart. He knew I
didn’t forget my vow. The next time I saw Little Hair,
ugh! I got his heart. I have said all.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>And, Indian-like, he stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>We all knew that the greater part of this was true,
since it tallied with the government account of the death
of the sutler and Surgeon Hontzinger. But we wanted
to hear how he took Tom Custer’s heart. McFadden,
who is quite an artist as well as an actor of note, had
made an imaginary sketch of “Custer’s Last Charge.”
He got it and handed it to Rain, saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does that look anything like the fight?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain studied it a long time, and then burst out
laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he said, “this picture is a lie. These long
swords have swords—they never fought us with swords,
but with guns and revolvers. These men are on ponies—they
fought us on foot, and every fourth man held the
others’ horses. That’s always their way of fighting. We
tie ourselves onto our ponies and fight in a circle. These
people are not dressed as we dress in a fight. They look
like agency Indians—we strip naked and have ourselves
and our ponies painted. This picture gives us bows and
arrows. We were better armed than the long swords.
Their guns wouldn’t shoot but once—the thing wouldn’t
throw out the empty cartridge shells. (In this he was
historically correct, as dozens of guns were picked up on
the battle-field by General Gibbon’s command two days
after with the shells still sticking in them, showing that
the ejector wouldn’t work.) When we found they could
not shoot we saved our bullets by knocking the long
swords over with our war clubs—it was just like killing
sheep. Some of them got on their knees and begged;
we spared none—ugh! This picture is like all the white
man’s pictures of Indians, a lie. I will show you how it
looked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then turning it over, he pulled out a stump of a lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>pencil from his pouch and drew a large shape of a letter
S, turned sideways.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c007'><sup>[94]</sup></a> “Here,” said he, “is the Little Big
Horn river; we had our lodges along the banks in the
shape of a bent bow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many lodges did you have?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, many, many times ten. We were like blades of
grass. (It is estimated that there were between four and
six thousand Indians, hence there must have been at
least a thousand lodges.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sitting Bull had made big medicine way off on a hill.
He came in with it; he had it in a bag on a coup-stick.
He made a big speech and said that Waukontonka (the
Great Spirit) has come to him riding on an eagle. Waukontonka
had told him that the long swords were coming,
but the Indians would wipe them off the face of the
earth. His speech made our hearts glad. Next day
our runners came in and told us the long swords were
coming. Sitting Bull had the squaws put up empty
death lodges along the bend of the river to fool the Ree
scouts when they came up and looked down over the
bluffs. The brush and the bend hid our lodges. Then
Sitting Bull went away to make more medicine and
didn’t come back till the fight was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gall was head chief; Crazy Horse led the Cheyennes;
Goose the Bannocks. I was not a head chief—my
brother Iron Horn was—but I had a band of the
worst Unkpapas; all of them had killed more enemies
than they had fingers and toes. When the long swords
came, we knew their ponies were tired out; we knew they
were fooled by the death lodges. They thought we were
but a handful.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“We knew they made a mistake when they separated.
Gall took most of the Indians up the river to come in
between them and cut them off. When we saw the Ree
scouts had stayed back with Long Yellow Hair, we were
glad. We saw them trotting along, and let them come
in over the bluffs. Some of our young men went up the
gully which they had crossed and cut them off from
behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we showed our line in front, and the long
swords charged. They reeled under our fire and started
to fall back. Our young men behind them opened
fire. Then we saw some officers talking and pointing.
Don’t know who they were, for they all looked alike. I
didn’t see Long Yellow Hair then or afterward. We
heard the Rees singing their death song—they knew we
had them. All dismounted, and every fourth man held
the others’ ponies. Then we closed all around them.
We rushed like a wave does at the sand out there (the
ocean beach) and shot the pony holders and stampeded
the ponies by waving our blankets in their faces. Our
squaws caught them, for they were tired out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had sung the war song, I had smelt the powder
smoke. My heart was bad—I was like one that has no
mind. I rushed in and took their flag; my pony fell
dead as I took it. I cut the thong that bound me. I
jumped up and brained the long sword flag-man with
my war club, and ran back to our line with the flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The long sword’s blood and brains splashed in my
face. It felt hot, and blood ran in my mouth. I could
taste it. I was mad. I got a fresh pony and rushed
back, shooting, cutting, and slashing. This pony was
shot, and I got another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This time I saw Little Hair. I remembered my
vow. I was crazy; I feared nothing. I knew nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>would hurt me, for I had my white weasel-tail charm on.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c007'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
(He wears the charm to this day.) I don’t know how
many I killed trying to get at him. He knew me. I
laughed at him and yelled at him. I saw his mouth
move, but there was so much noise I couldn’t hear his
voice. He was afraid. When I got near enough I
shot him with my revolver. My gun was gone, I don’t
know where. I leaped from my pony and cut out his
heart and bit a piece out of it and spit it in his face. I
got back on my pony and rode off shaking it. I was satisfied
and sick of fighting; I didn’t scalp him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t go back on the field after that. The squaws
came up afterward and killed the wounded, cut their
boot legs off for moccasin soles, and took their money,
watches, and rings. They cut their fingers off to get
them quicker. They hunted for Long Yellow Hair to
scalp him, but could not find him. He didn’t wear his
fort clothes (uniform), his hair had been cut off, and the
Indians didn’t know him. (This corroborates what Mrs.
Custer says about her husband’s having his long yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>curls cut at St. Paul some weeks before he was
killed.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“That night we had a big feast and the scalp dance.
Then Sitting Bull came up and made another speech.
He said: ‘I told you how it would be. I made great
medicine. My medicine warmed your hearts and made
you brave.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He talked a long time. All the Indians gave him
the credit of winning the fight because his medicine
won it. But he wasn’t in the fight. Gall got mad
at Sitting Bull that night. Gall said: ‘We did the fighting,
you only made medicine.’ It would have been
the same anyway. Their hearts were bad toward each
other after that, always.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After that fight we could have killed all the others
on the hill (Reno’s command) but for the quarrel between
Gall and Sitting Bull. Both wanted to be head
chief. Some of the Indians said Gall was right and went
with him. Some said Sitting Bull was. I didn’t care, I
was my own chief and had my bad young men; we
would not obey either of them unless we wanted to, and
they feared us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was sick of fighting—I had had enough. I wanted
to dance. We heard more long swords were coming
with wheel guns (artillery, Gatlings). We moved camp
north. They followed many days till we crossed the
line. I stayed over there till Sitting Bull came back,
and I came back with him. That’s all there is to tell.
I never told it to white men before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had finished, I said to him: “Rain, if you
didn’t kill Long Yellow Hair, who did?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know. No one knows. It was like running
in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” asked Mac, “why was it Long Yellow Hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>wasn’t scalped, when every one else was? Did you consider
him too brave to be scalped?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no one is too brave to be scalped; that wouldn’t
make any difference. The squaws wondered afterward
why they couldn’t find him. He must have laid under
some other dead bodies. I didn’t know, till I heard it
long afterward from the whites, that he wasn’t scalped.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many Indians were killed in the fight?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t remember, but about ten and four or ten and
six.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How about Curley, the Crow scout, who claims to
have escaped?” asked Mac.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh! I know Curley. He is a liar. He never
was in the fight. His pony stumbled and broke something.
He stayed behind to fix it. When he heard the
firing, he ran off like a whipped dog. One long sword
escaped, though; his pony ran off with him and went
past our lodges. They told me about it at Chicago. I
saw the man there, and I remembered hearing the squaws
tell about it after the fight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain-in-the-Face (Itiomagaju) is about sixty years of
age now, and is the only chief that survives to tell the
tale of the Custer fight. Gall and Sitting Bull have both
gone to hunt the white buffalo long since. Rain can
write his name in English. I taught him to do it at
the World’s Fair in order to sell Longfellow’s poem, entitled
“The Revenge of Rain-in-the-Face.” He doesn’t
know the significance of it after he writes it. His knowledge
of English is confined to about thirty words, but he
can’t say them so any one can understand him, though
he can understand almost anything that is said in English.
Like all other Indians, his gratitude is for favors
to come and not for favors already shown. He is utterly
heartless and unprincipled, physically brave but morally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>a coward. His redeeming feature lies in the fact that
you can depend upon any promise he makes, but it takes
a world of patience to get him to promise anything. Even
at the age of sixty he is still a Hercules. In form and
face he is the most pronounced type of the ideal Fenimore
Cooper, dime novel Indian in America.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f93'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r93'>93</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Sun Dance is that ceremonial performance in which the young Sioux aspirant
gives that final proof of endurance and courage which entitles him to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</span></i> of a
full-fledged warrior. One feature of it is the suspension in air of the candidate by a rawhide
rope passed through slits cut in the breast, or elsewhere, until the flesh tears and he
falls to the ground. If he faints, falters, or fails, or even gives way momentarily to his
anguish during the period of suspension, he is damned forever after, and is called and
treated as a squaw for the rest of his miserable life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain-in-the-Face was lucky when he was so tied up. The tendons gave way easily,
and he was released after so short a suspension that it was felt he had not fairly won his
spurs. Sitting Bull, the chief medicine man, decided that the test was unsatisfactory.
Rain-in-the-Face thereupon defied Sitting Bull to do his worst, declaring there was no
test which could wring a murmur of pain from his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting Bull was equal to the occasion. He cut deep slits in the back over the kidneys—the
hollows remaining were big enough almost to take in a closed fist years after—and
passed the rawhide rope through them. For two days the young Indian hung suspended,
taunting his torturers, jeering at them, defying them to do their worst, while
singing his war songs and boasting of his deeds. The tough flesh muscles and tendons
would not tear loose, although he kicked and struggled violently to get free. Finally,
Sitting Bull, satisfied that Rain-in-the-Face’s courage and endurance were above proof,
ordered buffalo skulls to be tied to his legs, and the added weight with some more vigorous
kicking enabled the Indian stoic to break free. It was one of the most wonderful
exhibitions of stoicism, endurance, and courage ever witnessed among the Sioux, where
these qualities were not infrequent. Rain-in-the-Face had passed the test. No one
thereafter questioned his courage. He was an approved warrior, indeed. It was while
suspended thus that he boasted of the murder of Dr. Hontzinger, and was overheard by
Charlie Reynolds, the scout, who told Custer and the regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Edward Esmonde, a companion of Mr. Thomas during the season he had Rain-in-the-Face
and his fellows at the World’s Fair in Chicago and afterward at Coney Island
in his charge, gave me the information in this note.—C. T. B.</p>

in this battle. A bullet pierced his right leg above the knee. Among the plunder
which fell to him after the action was over was a razor taken from the person of some
dead soldier. With this razor the wounded man essayed some home-made surgery.
First he cut deeply into the front of his leg, but failed to reach the bullet. Then he
reached around to the back of his leg and chopped recklessly into the flesh from that
quarter. He got the bullet, also several tendons, and narrowly missed cutting the artery
and bleeding to death. He was lame and had to walk on crutches all his life thereafter.</p>

smaller affairs are worthy of mention. One,
though nothing but a skirmish, was of great importance
in determining the final result. The other well
illustrates something of the adventurous life and perilous
duty of a soldier in Indian warfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Saturday, July 15, 1876, the Fifth Cavalry, under
General Wesley Merritt, was marching toward Fort
Laramie, under orders to join Crook. At noon word was
received from the agency that a body of Cheyennes, numbering,
perhaps, one thousand warriors, who had heretofore
remained quiet on the reservation at the Red
Cloud Agency, on the White River, South Dakota—the
Pine Ridge Agency—was about to break away and join
the Indians in the field. Their minds had been inflamed
by the story of Crook’s defeat and the account of
the disaster to the Seventh Cavalry. They thought they
saw unlimited opportunities for plunder, scalp-taking,
and successful fighting—therefore they decided to go on
the war-path without delay. There were not troops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>enough near the agency to prevent this action, which was
entirely unsuspected anyway.</p>

<p class='c000'>The orders for Merritt to join Crook were imperative;
but, in view of this news, the general decided to disregard
them for the present. He realized that he could perform
no better service than heading off this body of
Cheyennes, and either defeating and scattering them or,
better still, forcing them back to the agency.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trail they would have to take would cross a creek
in the extreme southeast corner of South Dakota, called
the War Bonnet,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c007'><sup>[96]</sup></a> some eighty-five miles, by the only
practicable route, from where the Fifth Cavalry then
was. The Indians were a much shorter distance from it.
Merritt would have had to march around, practically,
three sides of a square, owing to the configuration of the
country, to reach that point, which was the best place for
miles around, within the knowledge of W. F. Cody (Buffalo
Bill), his chief scout, to intercept the flying Cheyennes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Merritt did not hesitate an instant after learning the
news. He put his command in motion immediately, and
by a forced march of thirty-one hours, got to the crossing
in good time. There was no evidence that the Cheyennes
had passed. The troopers concealed themselves
in ravines under the bluff’s, and waited for the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early on the morning of July 17th, the pickets, commanded
by Lieutenant Charles King,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c007'><sup>[97]</sup></a> observed the
approach of the Indians. At about the same time Merritt’s
wagon train, under Lieutenant Hall, with two hundred
infantrymen spoiling for a fight, concealed in the
wagons as a guard, was observed toiling along, some four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>miles to the southwest, in an endeavor to reach the rendezvous
on the War Bonnet. The regiment remained
carefully concealed, and the Indians, in high glee,
thought they had the train at their mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So soon as he sighted the Cheyennes, Lieutenant Hall
despatched two troopers of his small cavalry escort
ahead to the crossing to apprise Merritt that the Indians
were at hand. An advance party of Cheyennes,
superbly mounted and led by a gorgeous young chief,
determined to intercept these troopers, who were ignorant
of their peril. The two soldiers came down one
trail which led through a ravine, the Indians came up
another which led through another ravine. The troopers
and the Cheyennes were hidden from each other,
but both were in plain view of the picket on the hill. The
two trails joined at the foot of the hill. The plain back
of the wagon-train was black—or red, rather—with Indians
coming up rapidly, although they were not yet
near enough to attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Merritt and one or two other officers, with Buffalo
Bill and a few of his scouts and several troopers, joined
King on the hill. The main body of the Indians was too
far away to attack, so the little advance party determined
to wait until the Cheyennes, who were endeavoring to
cut off the two soldiers, were close at hand and then fall
upon them. Everybody withdrew from the crest of the
hill except Lieutenant King, who was to give the signal,
when the party below should sally around it and fall on
the Cheyennes.</p>

<p class='c000'>King, who has described the situation with masterly
skill in his “Campaigning with Crook,” flattened himself
out on the brow of the hill, with nothing showing
but the top of his hatless head and his field glass, and
watched the soldiers rapidly galloping up one trail and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the Indians more rapidly rushing down the other. He
waited until the Indians had almost reached the junction.
Then he gave the signal. Merritt’s escort and
Cody’s scouts raced around the base of the hill, and
dashed slap into the faces of the astonished Cheyennes.
Two Indian saddles were emptied in the twinkling of
an eye. Such was the impetus of their charge that the
Indians scarcely had time to rein in their steeds before
the white men were upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Buffalo Bill shot the leader of the war party, a famous
young chief named Yellow Hand, through the leg. The
bullet also pierced the heart of the pony Yellow Hand
was riding. Both crashed to the earth. In spite of his
pain, Yellow Hand dragged himself to his feet and fired
at the scout, killing his horse. The two, not twenty
paces apart, exchanged shots the next instant. The
Indian missed, but Buffalo Bill sent a bullet through
Yellow Hand’s breast. The Indian reeled, but before
he fell Cody leaped upon him and drove his knife into
his gallant enemy’s heart. Yellow Hand was a dead Indian
when he struck the ground. “Jerking the war
bonnet off,” he says, “I scientifically scalped him in
about five seconds.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c007'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yellow Hand had recognized Buffalo Bill, and had
virtually challenged him to this duel. “The first scalp
for Custer!” shouted Cody, waving his trophy in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the other Indians had now come within range.
They opened fire upon the little party; the bullets zipped
around them in every direction, one narrowly grazing
General Merritt. They nicked a horse here and there,
but, as usual, their marksmanship was execrable.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the little party charged the Indians, Merritt had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>directed King to order the rest of the regiment to
advance. In the midst of the firing, the splendid
troops of the dandy Fifth came bursting through the
ravines and over the hills, making for the Cheyennes
on the gallop. At the same time Lieutenant Hall’s
infantrymen scrambled out of their wagons and sent a
few volleys at the Cheyennes at long range.
A more astonished body of Indians the United States
has probably never contained. They hadn’t the slightest
idea that there was a soldier within five hundred
miles, except those in the wagon train which they had
expected to capture. They had anticipated no trouble
whatever in joining Sitting Bull, and now they found
themselves suddenly face to face with one of the finest
cavalry regiments in the service. What were they to
do? They hadn’t much time to decide, for the cavalry
were after them at full gallop. They turned and fled
incontinently. They stood not on the order of their
going, but went at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they could get back to the reservation, they would
be free from attack. They fled at the highest possible
speed of their horses, throwing aside everything they
possessed, save their guns and ammunition, in their
frantic desire to get away. For thirty miles Merritt and
his men pursued them with the best will in the world to
come up with them; but the horses of the soldiers were
more or less tired from their long march of the day before,
and the Indians, lightly equipped and on fresh
horses, finally succeeded in escaping. By nightfall the
whole party was back on the reservation. Thereafter
care was taken that they found no further opportunity
to go on the war-path.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coöperation of this splendid body of Indians
with that under the command of Crazy Horse might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>possibly have turned the scale in some of the hotly contested
battles, and Merritt’s promptness was greatly
commended by the authorities. Buffalo Bill received
the chief glory of the little adventure from his dramatic
duel with Yellow Hand, in full view of soldiers and
Indians.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Sibley Scout</h4>

<p class='c020'>The other event is known in army records as The Sibley
Scout. While General Crook was waiting for reinforcements
and additional supplies at his camp on
Goose Creek, near the Tongue River, he decided to
send out a scouting party to see what had become of
his friend, Crazy Horse, who had handled him so
severely at the Rosebud a few weeks before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Frederick W. Sibley, of E Troop, of the
Third Cavalry, an enterprising but cool-headed young
officer, was given command of twenty-five picked men
from the regiment. With him went scouts Frank
Gruard and Baptiste Pourier, commonly known as “Big
Bat,” to distinguish him from another scout, Baptiste,
a smaller man. To the party also were attached John
Becker, mule packer, and the indefatigable Finerty,
the war correspondent of the Chicago <cite>Times</cite>, making
a total of thirty men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each man carried one hundred rounds of ammunition
on his person, and a few days’ rations in his saddle-bags.
They started on the 6th of July. On the 7th they had
reached the Rosebud, some fifty miles away from Crook’s
camp. There they came across the Indians. Gruard
and Pourier observed them from the top of a hill, behind
which the rest of the expedition halted. There were
hundreds of them, apparently, and the scouts rejoined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the command immediately. To take the back track
was impossible. Therefore, they struck westward over
the mountains, leading their horses. The Indians,
marching slowly southward, soon came upon the trail of
the party, and followed it at some distance. Urged by
the imminence of their peril, the men, led by the unerring
Gruard, who was familiar with all the ramifications
of the Big Horn Range, since he had often hunted there
during his captivity with the Sioux, did some rapid mountain
climbing, and finally thought they had escaped pursuit,
especially as no one could ride up the trail up which
they had climbed, and these Indians were poor trailers
when on foot. Having progressed some five miles over
terrific trails, they halted in a little glade under the shade
of some trees, unsaddled their horses, made coffee, and
ate dinner. Feeling themselves safe from pursuit, they
rested for several hours, and it was not until late in the
afternoon that they took up their march again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The going here was easier than before, and they could
mount their horses once more. Presently they trotted
into a level, thickly wooded valley. The trail led along
the right side of the mountain, which was broken and
rugged. There were woods to the left and in front of
them, and high rocks and open timber on the right.
John Becker, who brought up the rear, suddenly alarmed
everybody by the shout of “Indians, Indians!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next instant the timber and boulders to the right
were alive with a war party of Sioux and Cheyennes, not
two hundred yards away—not the same party they had
seen in the valley, by the way. So soon as the Indians
appeared they opened fire. Again their shooting was
bad. Not a trooper was hurt, although a number of
horses were hit, some seriously. Sibley acted with
prompt decision. A word with Gruard determined him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>in his course. Under a spattering fire from the Indians,
the party turned to the left and raced for the thick timber
as fast as they could go. They threw themselves to
the ground in a semi-circular line so soon as they reached
the woods, tied their horses to the trees back of them,
and taking advantage of fallen logs and boulders as a
breastwork, opened fire upon the Indians, who, on their
part, sought concealment and commenced firing in earnest.
The soldiers were well protected in the forest,
however, and although the Indians killed many of the
horses, they did not hit any of the troopers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party was now overwhelmingly outnumbered.
There were already several hundred Indians engaged.
Their leader was a magnificent young Cheyenne chief,
dressed in a suit of white buckskin. It was afterward
learned that his name was White Antelope. Gruard
was recognized by the Indians, who were desirous of
taking him alive. After firing for perhaps half an hour,
White Antelope led the Indians on foot in a direct
charge on the woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sibley ordered his men to hold their fire until they
could make every shot tell. They mowed the advancing
Indians down in scores. White Antelope was seen
to leap into the air and fall. He had been pierced, it
was afterward learned, by several bullets, and started
for the happy hunting grounds then and there. The
charge was handsomely repulsed, and the Indians retired
in confusion, although still keeping up a severe fire.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was evident to every one that the Indians would
hold the soldiers in play until they were joined by other
war parties—indeed, their numbers were increased already—when
Sibley’s detachment would be surrounded
and exterminated. Gruard, therefore, proposed abandoning
the horses—most of them had been killed anyway—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>that the whole party should steal away
through the timber and endeavor to escape over the
mountains on foot. Firing two or three volleys and
then keeping up a scattering fire for a short time to make
the Indians think they were on the alert, the troopers,
exercising the greatest caution, one by one crawled
through the underbrush until they were hidden by the
forest trees. Then everybody got up on his feet and
ran like mad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gruard, whose instincts as a guide were of the highest
order, led them over magnificent mountains, through
gloomy cañons, past overhanging cliffs, along impossible
trails on the sides of tremendous precipices, one of
which stretched for several hundred feet below them and
three hundred feet above them, almost sheer. Not being
mountaineers, they would have been utterly unable to
have followed the scout had it not been for the Red Terror
that lurked behind. They had succeeded in getting,
perhaps, a mile away from and some distance above the
valley, when they heard several heavy volleys, followed
by a series of wild yells, which apprised them that the
Indians had at last rushed their camp. They were so
confident of escape now that they actually burst into
roars of laughter at the thought of the Indian disappointment
when the attackers found their victims had
decamped. Those Indians were not accustomed to
hunt on foot. An Indian off a horse is about as awkward
as a sailor on one. The pursuit was soon abandoned,
and the soldiers left to follow their course unmolested.
Theirs had been a lucky escape. Without
Gruard, they had all been killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day was frightfully hot. The fast going caused
by the exigencies of the occasion and the desperate
nature of the climbing increased their discomfort. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>men threw away everything in the way of superfluous
clothing which would impede their progress or tire them
in their hurry, save their weapons and ammunition.
They camped that night, or halted, rather, for there was
nothing with which to camp, on the crest of the range.
It turned very cold, a terrible storm arose, and they
suffered severely. They had nothing to eat; their provisions
had been in their saddle-bags, and they had not
dared to take them in their attempt to escape, lest the
suspicions of the Indians should be excited by their
efforts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, the 9th of July, they started down the
mountain. Gruard’s instincts were not at fault. He
led them to the foot-hills overlooking Crook’s main camp
far away. In order to reach the plain they had to cross
a rapid mountain brook, the water of which came almost
up to their necks. Two men who could not swim
and who were in a very nervous condition from their exciting
adventures, stubbornly refused to try to cross the
stream, even with the assistance of their comrades. They
chose rather to hide themselves where they were, and
begged that help might be sent back to them. The rest
of the party managed to cross and started for the camp,
still about fifteen miles distant. They were met in the
evening by a scouting party of soldiers, who brought
them back to camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their clothing and shoes were torn to ribbons, and
they were greatly exhausted from the terrible strains and
hardships to which they had been subjected. That they
escaped at all was a miracle, due to the coolness of young
Sibley and the marvelous skill of Gruard. A detachment
went back for the two men who had remained
behind and brought them back to the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieutenant Sibley reported to General Crook that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>had found the Indians, but whether that statement is
accurate is a question. It would, perhaps, be more truthful
to say that the Indians had found him. Sibley and
Gruard were highly complimented by Crook; and Mr.
Finerty, who had displayed great courage, wrote a
graphic account of it, from which this brief sketch has
been abridged.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER NINE<br /> <span class='large'>The First Success</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Crook and Mills at Slim Buttes</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>After the defeat of General Custer, and the
successful retreat of the Sioux and Cheyennes
from the Little Big Horn, the government
hurried reinforcements into the field, and
ordered Crook and Terry to press the pursuit of the
Indians with the greatest vigor. It was not, however,
until nearly a year after the disaster on the Little Big
Horn that the Sioux war was concluded, and it was not
until after the Indians had met with several crushing
defeats and had been pursued until they were utterly
exhausted that peace was declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest individual factor in bringing about this
much desired result was General George Crook, a celebrated
cavalryman during the Civil War, and a more
celebrated Indian fighter after its close. With unwearied
tenacity and vigor he pursued the savages, striking
them through his subordinates whenever and wherever
they could be found. The terrible persistence with
which he urged his faint, starving, foot-sore, tattered
soldiers along the trail, to which he clung with a resolution
and determination that nothing could shake, entitles
him to the respect and admiration of his countrymen—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>respect and admiration, by the way, which was fully
accorded him by his gallant and equally desperate foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>After Crook, the men who brought about the result
were, first and foremost, Nelson A. Miles—singularly
enough not a cavalryman, but the Colonel of the Fifth
Infantry; and, next to him, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie,
of the Fourth Cavalry, and Captain Anson Mills, of
the Third, whom we have already noted doing gallant
service at the Battle of the Rosebud. Miles had been
ordered into the field to reinforce Terry’s shattered
and depleted column.</p>

<p class='c000'>After much marching and scouting, the columns of
Terry and Crook combined; but Terry’s forces were in
bad condition, and his command was soon withdrawn
from the field. What was left of the Seventh Cavalry
was sent back to Fort Lincoln, whence they had started
out with such bright hopes a few months before. Gibbon’s
command was returned to Montana, where it had
been made up, on account of the threatening aspect of
things in that quarter, and Terry retired from active
campaigning to resume command of his department.
Miles, as we shall see, was sent to the Yellowstone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook was left alone in the active pursuit. Space and
time are lacking to describe the details of the wonderful
marches he made on the trails of the Indians—now
under burning suns, which parched the ground until it
was as bare as the palm of a hand; again through torrents
of drenching rains, which succeeded the fierce
heat; and, finally, through the snows and cold of a
winter of unexampled severity. During the summer
there was no forage for the horses of the cavalry nor for
the very small pack train, and rations for the men became
shorter and shorter. Finally, early in September,
the supply of provisions was reduced to two and a half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>days’ rations. Crook calculated that they could march
two weeks on that amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>They supplemented the rations by living on horse
and mule meat and a few wild onions which they could
gather from time to time in spots which had escaped the
universal baking of the summer. At last the command
literally reached the end of its resources. The Indians
were in bad condition, too, but their situation was not
nearly so desperate as was that of Crook and his men.
The Indians were worn out and exhausted by the
energetic and relentless pursuit which had been hurled
after them by the indomitable commander, but they
still had plenty to eat, and they had managed to keep
ahead of him, and to avoid various scouting columns.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 7th of September, 1876, Crook realized that
his men had reached the limit of their endurance, and
that forage and food must be procured or they would
all die in the wilderness. The Indians had swept the
country bare of game, and the sun had swept it clean of
fodder. One hundred and fifty of the best men—that is,
those who showed the fewest signs of the hardships
they had undergone—with the best horses and the last
of the mules, were formed into an advance party under
Captain Anson Mills, of the Third Cavalry. Mills had
instructions to push on to Deadwood City, one of the
new towns in the Black Hills, to get provisions, “Any
kind of provisions, for God’s sake!” which he could bring
back to the rest of the army, now in a destitute condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills was not expected to hunt for, or to fight, Indians—primarily,
that is. He was to go for food in
order to keep the army from starving; but as he
marched southward, his scouts discovered a large village
of forty or fifty lodges at a place called Slim Buttes, in
the northwest corner of South Dakota. The tepees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>had been pitched on a little rising from the banks of a
small stream called Rabbit Creek. The place was inclosed
on three sides by a series of tall cliffs, whose
broken sides seemed here and there to have been cut
in half-formed terraces, making the ascent easy. Little
ravines and small cañons ran through the buttes,
gradually ascending until they met the plateau on top.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mills instantly determined to attack the camp—a wise
and soldierly action on his part. He made his dispositions
with care. Reaching the vicinity of the camp,
he halted in a deep gorge on the night of September 8,
and prepared for battle early the next morning. The
night was dark, cold, and very rainy, and the tired men
suffered greatly. Marching out at dawn, Mills succeeded
at daybreak in surprising the camp, which proved to
be that of a band of Sioux led by American Horse,
one of the most prominent chiefs. Leaving Lieutenant
Bubb with the pack train and the lead horses, Mills
directed Lieutenant Schwatka, afterward so well known
from his Arctic explorations, to charge directly into the
village with twenty-five mounted men. The remainder
of his force he dismounted and divided into two parties,
under Lieutenants Von Luettwitz and Crawford, respectively,
with orders to move on the camp from different
sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attack was a complete success. The village
was taken with but little loss. Some of the Sioux were
killed and others captured, but most escaped through
the ravines to the plateau surrounding the valley. One
heroic but unfortunate little band, consisting of American
Horse and four warriors, with fifteen women and
children, was driven into one of the cañons which
ended in a cave. One or two of the soldiers had been
wounded in the attack. Lieutenant Von Luettwitz,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>who had fought all through the Franco-Austrian War
in Italy, and who was a veteran of the Civil War, was
shot in the knee and so badly wounded that his leg had
to be amputated on the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being now in complete command of the village, the
pack train was ordered up and the captured village was
examined. To the joy of Mills and his soldiers, an
immense quantity of provisions, in the shape of meat,
forage, and other stores, was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>There still remained the little band of savages in the
ravine to be dealt with. A detachment was ordered to
drive them out. The Indians had been busy making
rifle-pits, and as the soldiers advanced to storm the cave,
they were met with a rapid and well-directed fire. Two
of them were shot dead and others wounded.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c007'><sup>[99]</sup></a> The
Indian position appeared to be impregnable. An interpreter
crept near enough under cover to make himself
heard, and asked their surrender. They replied to his
command with taunts and jeers. They incautiously
informed him, however, that Crazy Horse with his
warriors was in the vicinity, and on being apprised of
their situation by some of the fugitives, he would undoubtedly
come to their rescue. Crazy Horse could
have made short work of Mills and his hundred and
fifty. Meanwhile the survivors of the village, which
had contained a hundred warriors, formed an extended
line on the buttes and opened fire on the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Mills acted promptly. He despatched a courier to
Crook on the best horse in the command, to report the
situation and ask him for reinforcements at once.
Incidentally, he mentioned that a great quantity of provisions
had been found. Then he made preparations to
hold the place, and at the same time to prosecute his
attack against the cave, all the time keeping up a smart
fight with the men on the buttes. So soon as Crook
received the message, he started forward, intending to
take with him a select body of men; but the whole army,
spoiling for a fight and hungry for a square meal, insisted
on going along. They made a forced march, and
reached Mills about half after eleven in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook immediately proceeded to dislodge the Indians
in the cave. The men were led forward under a galling
fire, to which the general, in spite of the entreaties of
his staff, exposed himself with indifference. When they
got in a position to command the cave, Crook, willing to
spare his brave foemen, again asked them to surrender.
His request was met by a decided negative. The men
opened fire, and searched every cranny and recess of the
cave with a storm of bullets. Gruard, one of the
scouts, taking advantage of cover, crept to the very
mouth of the cave, remained there unobserved, watched
his opportunity, seized a squaw who incautiously exposed
herself, and with her as a shield dashed forward
and shot one of the warriors, escaping in safety himself.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Death of American Horse</h4>

<p class='c020'>After two hours of firing, the death-chants of the
squaws induced Crook to order a cessation for another
parley. This time his request that the Indians surrender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>met with some response; for the squaws and
children, to the number of thirteen, came reluctantly
forth on his positive assurance that they would be protected.
The braves refused to give up. They were
confident that Crazy Horse would succor them. The
engagement at once began again, but after it had lasted
some little time the fire of the Indians ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>The offer of mercy was made a fourth time. A young
Indian stepped out and received additional assurance
that no harm should come if they surrendered. He
went back into the cave and presently reappeared with
another young warrior, supporting between them the
tall, splendid figure of brave old American Horse. He
had been shot through the bowels, and his intestines
protruded from the wound. He was suffering frightful
agony, and was biting hard upon a piece of wood to
control himself. He handed his gun to Crook and gave
up the contest. The surgeons with the command did
everything they possibly could for him, but his wound
was beyond human skill. That night, surrounded by
his wives and children, he died, as stoically and as
bravely as he had lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside the cave the rocky walls were cut and scored
by the rain of bullets which had been poured into it,
and lying on the floor were the bodies of the two Indian
warriors, together with a woman and a child, who had
been killed. The soldiers had not known, until the
squaws came out, that there were any women or
children there. The little band had sold their lives
dearly. Even the women had used guns, and had displayed
all the bravery and courage of the Sioux.</p>

<p class='c000'>Too late Crazy Horse, with some six hundred warriors,
appeared on the scene. Imagining he had only
to deal with Mills’ small force, he galloped gallantly forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>to the attack at about five o’clock. He was greatly
astonished at the number of antagonists developed
thereby. He retired to the top of the buttes, and the
soldiers in gallant style dashed after him. They scaled
the cliffs, finally gaining the level plateau. Crazy
Horse made one or two attempts to break through the
line, but it was impossible, and seeing himself greatly
outnumbered, he wisely retired, having sustained some
loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle was one of the most picturesque ever
fought in the West. Crook and his officers stood in the
camp, the center of a vast amphitheater ringed with fire,
up the sides of which the soldiers steadily climbed to get
at the Indians, silhouetted in all their war finery against
the sky. The loss of life on either side was not great,
but the capture of the village and the provisions which
had been accumulated for the winter was a serious one.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the camp were discovered many articles that had
belonged to the Seventh Cavalry—a guidon, money, one
of Captain Keogh’s gauntlets, marked with his name,
orderly books, saddles, etc. Among other things, were
letters written by officers and soldiers to friends in the
East, some of them still sealed and ready for mailing.
They must have come like voices from the dead when
they reached those to whom they had been written.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r99'>99</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the scouts killed in this battle was a great admirer of Buffalo Bill, whose
manners, methods, and appearance he aped as well as he could. He rejoiced in an unfortunate
sobriquet, which was received in this wise: General Sheridan, seeking Buffalo Bill
to lead a hunting expedition on one occasion, was met by this swaggerer, with the remark
that Buffalo Bill was gone away, and when Buffalo Bill was gone he was Buffalo Bill
himself. “The h—l you are!” said Sheridan contemptuously. “Buffalo Chip, you
mean!” The poor braggart never got away from the name of “Buffalo Chip Charlie.”
He was a brave man for all his vanity, and the soldiers were sorry enough for their mockery
when they buried him that night at the foot of the buttes, where he had fallen in the
attack on the cave.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER TEN<br /> <span class='large'>A Decisive Blow</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Mackenzie’s Winter Battle</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Crook now gave over the pursuit, and returned
to Fort Fetterman to organize a winter
campaign. This expedition was one of the
best equipped that ever started on an Indian
campaign. It contained all arms of the service,
with an abundance of everything necessary to success.
To follow its marches to the Big Horn Range
would reveal little of interest; but late in November it
was learned, from a captured Cheyenne, that the principal
Cheyenne village was located in a cañon through
which flowed one of the main sources of Crazy Woman’s
Fork of the Powder River. Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie
was ordered, with the Indian scouts and ten troops of
cavalry from the Second, Fourth, and Fifth regiments,
to find and destroy the village.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cheyennes were not so numerous as the Sioux,
and the greater number of their allies has sometimes
caused people to minimize the quality of the Cheyennes;
but no braver, more magnificent fighters ever lived than
this same tribe. They had some of the Homeric qualities
of the ancient Greeks. I believe it will generally
be admitted that they were the finest of the Plains Indians.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>They were foemen worthy Mackenzie’s or anybody
else’s steel. The battle which ensued was in some
respects one of the most terrible in Western history,
and in its results exemplified, as few others have done,
the horrible character of the war. It was, perhaps, as
great a contribution to the downfall of the Sioux as any
single incident that occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mackenzie’s men left the main encampment on the
23d of November. The ground was covered with snow.
The weather was arctic in its severity. The scouts
and friendly Indians—Pawnees, Crows, Shoshones,
the hereditary enemies of the Cheyennes, including certain
Cheyennes also who had entered the service of the
United States<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c007'><sup>[100]</sup></a>—had located the camp in Willow
Creek Cañon. Some of the Indians had kept the camp
under observation while Mackenzie brought up his
troops. He had seven hundred and fifty cavalrymen and
three hundred and fifty Indians. Halting at the mouth
of the cañon, which he reached on the night of the 24th,
he resolved to await the still hours before the break of
day the next morning before delivering his attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cañon was a gloomy gorge in the Big Horn Mountains.
A swift, ice-bound river rushed over the rocks
between precipitous walls, which soared into the sky
for perhaps a thousand feet on either side. Numberless
icy brooks poured their contents into the main
stream through lateral cañons scarcely less forbidding
in their appearance than the main one, and which made
the trail of the creek almost impossible. Here and
there the cañon widened, and in one of these open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>places the Cheyennes, under the leadership of Dull
Knife, had pitched their camp. They fondly believed
the place impregnable—as, indeed, with careful guarding
it would have been. The greatest precaution was
taken by Mackenzie to prevent his men from making
any noise. They stood in ranks by their horses in the
snow in that polar cold, waiting for the order for the
advance. Presently the moon rose, flooding the recesses
of the ravine with silvery light, which sparkled with
dazzling brilliancy upon patches of snow here and there
on the dark walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mackenzie, calculating that day would be breaking
just about the time he would reach the camp from his
present position, at last gave order to take up the march.
With what relief the benumbed troopers sprang to
their saddles and urged their shivering horses forward,
can scarcely be imagined by dwellers in peaceful lands
around warm firesides. As they struggled up the cañon
they could hear the sound of dancing and revelry in the
Indian camp, faintly blown back to them by the night
wind. They learned afterward that the Cheyennes had
just returned from a successful raid on the Shoshones,
and that the dance was in celebration of an important
victory they had gained. They halted again, therefore,
until all was silence, before they once more advanced.
Day was beginning to break as they reached the village.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sleeping Indians in the camp had not the slightest
suspicion that the enemy was within a hundred miles.
The troops, cheering and shouting, burst upon them
like a winter storm. Indians, when not apprehensive
of attack, invariably sleep naked. The Cheyennes had
just time to seize rifles and cartridge belts, while the
women caught hasty blankets about the children, when
the soldiers were upon them. Indeed, so quick and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>sudden was the attack that some of the warriors could
not get out of the tepees. With their knives they
slashed the wigwams, and from these openings fired upon
the soldiers as they galloped through the village.
Many were shot dead where a few moments before
they had slept in peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the pony herd was captured, and the village
in a short time was in possession of Mackenzie. The
Cheyennes, though overwhelmed, were undismayed.
They had retreated headlong up the cañon, but were
soon rallied by their subchiefs. Dull Knife, their leader,
was found in the village with half a dozen bullets in him.
He had fought gallantly in the open until he died.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently the Indians came swarming back along
the side of the cañon. They occupied points of vantage,
and, naked though they were in the frightful weather,
with the thermometer ranging from ten to twenty
degrees below zero during this campaign, they opened
fire upon their opponents. Unless they could be dislodged,
Mackenzie’s position was untenable. He sent
his Shoshone and other Indian scouts, who, animated
with bitter hatred of the Cheyennes, were eager to obey
his commands, to the summits of the cliffs to clear the
Indians from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile he directed Lieutenant John A. McKinney,
with his troop, to charge and drive the Indians
from a rocky eminence where they were concentrating
and from which they were pouring a hot fire upon the
soldiers. McKinney’s charge was entirely successful,
for he drove the Cheyennes back until he was stopped by
a ravine. Wheeling his men, he attempted to find a
crossing, when he was fired upon by a flanking party
of Indians and instantly killed, being hit no less than
six times. Six of his troopers were wounded, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>number of horses were shot. The troop was thrown
into confusion, and some of the men started to retreat.
Mackenzie, observing the situation, immediately ordered
Captain John M. Hamilton and Major G. A. Gordon
to charge to the rescue. The charge was gallantly
made and stubbornly resisted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fighting was hand to hand, of the fiercest description;
and the Cheyennes, while keeping the rest of Mackenzie’s
forces engaged, began concentrating on these
two troops, which had been joined by Captain Davis,
with his men. There was no reserve; the cavalry were
all in, and this detachment might have been wiped out
had it not been for the success of the Shoshones and
other Indians, who cleared the key to the position on
the summit of the plateau above the cañon, and then
came to the assistance of the sorely beset soldiers.
Twenty Cheyennes were killed here and several of the
soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Relieved in a measure by these two movements,
although not altogether, for the Cheyennes with their
superior knowledge of the topography of the country
could not be entirely dislodged from their position, and
kept up a fierce fire upon the soldiers all day long, to
which he could make little reply, Mackenzie sent back
word to Crook of his success, and meanwhile began the
destruction of the village. All the winter supplies for
over a thousand Indians were there. The Cheyennes
were a forehanded, prosperous tribe of Indians, as Indians
go, and the property destroyed was enormous.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. The Sufferings of the Cheyennes</h4>

<p class='c020'>What must have been the despair of the surprised
warriors, with their women and children, naked, shivering
in the hills, as they saw their belongings consumed
by the flames! It was simply impossible for them to
maintain their position during the night. They had
to move away or die of cold. As it was, twelve little
Indian babies froze to death that awful night. Many
of the older men and women were kept alive only by
having their hands and feet, and in the case of the children,
their whole bodies, thrust into the warm bodies
of the few ponies not captured by the soldiers, which
had been disemboweled for the purpose.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>There was no fighting on the 26th. The Cheyennes
took up a strong position six miles farther up the cañon,
from which Mackenzie could not dislodge them, and on
the 27th he started on his return to the camp. Crook,
who made a forced march night and day, with Colonel
Dodge and the infantry, who came forward with astonishing
speed in spite of storm and cold, met Mackenzie
retiring just after he left the cañon, and the whole army
returned to the encampment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subsequent sufferings of the Indians were frightful.
Naturally, they repaired to Crazy Horse, expecting
that he would succor them, feed them, and clothe
them. The Sioux and the Cheyennes had been warm
friends and allies, and had fought together on many a
field. Had they come in their prosperity, Crazy Horse
would have given them a warm welcome. As it was,
he had little with which to support his own band during
the winter, owing to Crook’s pursuit of him, and
with short-sighted, yet natural—from an Indian point
of view—policy, he refused to receive these Cheyennes,
or to share anything with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exasperated beyond measure by their treatment by the
Sioux, and swearing eternal vengeance upon Crazy Horse,
the wretched band struggled into the nearest agency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and surrendered, and in the following spring moved
out with the soldiers against Crazy Horse and his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is appalling to think of that night attack in that awful
weather upon that sleeping camp—to read of those wretched
women and children, wandering naked in that bitter
cold; to learn of those little ones frozen to death; of the
old men and women abandoned by the road to die—yet
there is another side to the picture, scarcely less horrible.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this Indian camp also were found many relics of
the Custer battle. So far as that is in question, I may
say that I consider that action to have been a fair and
square stand-up fight, in which one side was defeated
and its members all died fighting.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c007'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Naturally, the Indians
despoiled the slain for trophies. White soldiers
have done the same when conditions have been reversed,
as has been noted in the preceding chapters of this book.
Of course, the Indians mutilated the dead and tortured
the living, but some instances of both practices are
found among white men, and we cannot judge the Indian
by our standards, anyway.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the camp there were other evidences of savage
ferocity, from which the soul shrinks in horror, and which
showed that these Indians were among the most cruel
and ruthless on the continent, and that they were only
getting what they had given. Two instances will suffice.
The troops took from the body of a dead warrior
an unique necklace of human forefingers, which had
been displayed with pride upon his barbaric breast;<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c007'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
and a bag was found which contained the right hands of
twelve little Shoshone babies and children, which had
been recently cut from little arms to give some ruthless
warrior a ghastly trophy.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<div class='footnote' id='f100'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r100'>100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is a singular thing to note the looseness of the tie with which the members of the
various tribes were bound. Frequently we find bands of the same tribe fighting for and
against the United States on the same field. One of the most fruitful causes of the success
of our arms has been this willingness on the part of the Indians to fight against their
own people, of which the government has been quick to avail itself.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER ELEVEN<br /> <span class='large'>Miles’ Great Campaigning</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Miles and His Foot Cavalry Defeat Sitting Bull</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Now let us turn to Miles and his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Miles was ordered to march his
command up the Yellowstone to the mouth
of the Tongue River, and establish a temporary
post or cantonment there for the winter. He
was an officer in whom great confidence was reposed,
and from whom much was to be expected. He had
as brilliant a record in the Civil War as Custer, and
had practically fought one decisive battle in the closing
campaign on his own responsibility, with splendidly
successful results. He was a natural-born soldier, and
he never showed his talents to better advantage than in
the operations which followed. His career before and
after this period is still fresh in the minds of a grateful
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Crook and his men were hammering away in
one portion of the field, Miles was doing splendid service
in the other. The original intention had been to place
under his command some fifteen hundred men, but the
force he really received amounted only to about five
hundred. With these he was not expected to do more
than maintain his position, and acquire such information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>as he could in preparing for the spring and summer
campaign of the following year. That was not,
from his point of view, a satisfactory program.</p>

<p class='c000'>Veteran Indian fighters in the Northwest informed
him that it would be useless to try to reach the Indians
in the winter; but Miles was not that kind of a soldier.
If the Indians could live in tepees in that season, he saw
no reason why white soldiers should not move against
them in spite of the weather. He had one of the finest
regiments of infantry in the service—the Fifth. Based
upon the report of courts-martial, discipline, etc., no regiment
surpassed or even equaled its record. Miles himself
proved to be the most successful commander against
Indians that the war produced, and his success was not
due to what envious people called good luck. It was
well merited and thoroughly earned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government, upon the representations of Sheridan
and Sherman, which were based upon Miles’ previous
successful fighting with the Southwestern Indians,
allowed the young colonel everything he asked for. If
his troops were not completely equipped for the work in
which their commander designed to employ them, it
would be his fault. With wise forethought, he provided
the soldiers as if for an arctic expedition. They cut up
blankets for underwear. They were furnished with fur
boots and the heaviest kind of leggings and overshoes.
Every man had a buffalo overcoat and a woolen or fur
mask to go over his face under his fur cap. Their hands
were protected by fur gloves. It was well for them that
they were thus provided, for the winter of 1876–7 was one
of the most severe that had ever visited that section of the
country. The mercury frequently froze in the thermometer,
and on one occasion a temperature of sixty degrees
below zero was recorded by the spirit thermometer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Busying themselves during the late fall, which was, in
effect, winter, in the erection of the cantonment on the
Tongue and Yellowstone, the first important touch they
got with the Indians was on the 18th of October, when
Lieutenant-Colonel Elwell S. Otis, commanding a battalion
of four companies of the Twenty-third Infantry,
escorting a wagon-load of supplies from Glendive, Montana,
to the cantonment, was attacked by a large force of
hostiles. The attack was not delivered with any great
degree of force at first, but it grew in power until the
troops had to corral the train. The soldiers had a hard
fight to keep the animals from being stampeded and the
train captured. Having beaten off the Indians, the
train advanced, fighting, until Clear Creek was reached.
During a temporary cessation of the attacks a messenger
rode out from the Indian lines, waving a paper,
which he left upon a hill in line with the advance of the
train. When it was picked up, Colonel Otis found it to
be an imperious message—probably written by some
half-breed—from the chief whom he had been fighting.
It ran as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yellowstone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“I want to know what you are doing traveling on this
road. You scare all the buffalo away. I want to hunt
in this place. I want you to turn back from here. If
you don’t, I’ll fight you again. I want you to leave what
you have got here, and turn back from here.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am your friend,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>Sitting Bull</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“I mean all the rations you have got and some powder.
Wish you would write me as soon as you can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I consider this document unique in the history of Indian
warfare, and it well illustrates not only the spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>but the naïveté of the great chief. Otis despatched a
scout to Sitting Bull with the information that he intended
to take the train through to the cantonment in spite
of all the Indians on earth, and if Sitting Bull wanted to
have a fight, he (Otis) would be glad to accommodate him
at any time and on any terms. The train thereupon
moved out, and the Indians promptly recommenced the
fight. But the engagement was soon terminated by a
flag of truce. A messenger appeared, who stated that the
Indians were tired and hungry and wanted to treat for
peace. Otis asked Sitting Bull to come into his lines,
but that wily old chief refused, although he sent three
chiefs to represent him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Otis had no authority to treat for peace or anything
else, but he gave the Indians a small quantity of hardtack
and a couple of sides of bacon, and advised them to
go to the Tongue River and communicate with General
Miles. The train then moved on, and after following a
short distance, with threatening movements, the Indians
withdrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same night Otis fell in with Miles and his
whole force. Miles, being alarmed for Otis’ safety, had
marched out to meet him. The train was sent down to the
cantonment, and the troops, numbering three hundred
and ninety-eight, with one gun, started out in pursuit of
Sitting Bull. They overtook him on the 21st of October
at Cedar Creek. With Sitting Bull were Gall and
other celebrated chiefs, and one thousand warriors of
the Miniconjous, San Arcs, Brulés, and Unkpapas, together
with their wives and children, in all over three
thousand Indians. Crazy Horse, with the Oglalas
and Two Moon’s band of the Northern Cheyennes, were
not with Sitting Bull, while Dull Knife’s band, as we
have seen, had gone to Wyoming for the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>The reason for this separation is obvious. They
could better support the hardships of the winter, more
easily find shelter, and with less difficulty escape from
the pursuing soldiers, if they were broken up in smaller
parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting Bull asked Miles for an interview, which was
arranged. He was attended by a subchief and six warriors,
Miles by an aide and six troopers. The meeting
took place between the lines, all parties being on horseback.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting Bull wanted peace on the old basis. The Indians
demanded permission to retain their arms, with
liberty to hunt and roam at will over the plains and
through the mountains, with no responsibility to any
one, while the government required them to surrender
their arms and come into the agencies. The demands
were irreconcilable therefore. The interview was an interesting
one, and although it began calmly enough, it
grew exciting toward the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting Bull, whom Miles describes as a fine, powerful,
intelligent, determined looking man, was evidently
full of bitter and persistent animosity toward the white
race. He said no Indian that ever lived loved the white
man, and that no white man that ever lived loved the Indian;
that God Almighty had made him an Indian,
but He didn’t make him an Agency Indian, and he didn’t
intend to be one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner of the famous chief had been cold, but
dignified and courteous. As the conversation progressed,
he became angry—so enraged, in fact, that in Miles’
words “he finally gave an exhibition of wild frenzy.
His whole manner seemed more like that of a wild beast
than a human being. His face assumed a furious expression.
His jaws were tightly closed, his lips were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>compressed, and you could see his eyes glisten with the
fire of savage hatred.”<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c007'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>One cannot help admiring the picture presented by
the splendid, if ferocious, savage. I have no doubt that
General Miles himself admired him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the height of the conference a young warrior stole
out from the Indian lines and slipped a carbine under
Sitting Bull’s blanket. He was followed by several
other Indians to the number of a dozen, who joined
the band, evidently meditating treachery. Miles, who,
with his aide, was armed with revolver only, promptly
required these new auxiliaries to retire, else the conference
would be terminated immediately. His demand
was reluctantly obeyed. After some further talk, a second
meeting was appointed for the morrow, and the
conference broke up.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night Miles moved his command in position
to be able to intercept the movement of the Indians
the next day. There was another interview with the
picturesque and imperious savage, whose conditions of
peace were found to be absolutely impossible, since they
involved the abandonment of all the military posts, the
withdrawal of all settlers, garrisons, etc., from the country.
He wanted everything and would give nothing.
He spoke like a conqueror, and he looked like one, although
his subsequent actions were not in keeping with
the part. Miles, seeing the futility of further discussion,
peremptorily broke up the conference. He told Sitting
Bull that he would take no advantage of the flag of truce,
but that he would give him just fifteen minutes to get
back to his people to prepare for fighting. Shouting
defiance, the chiefs rode back to the Indian lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was “mounting in hot haste” surely, and hurried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>preparations were made for immediate battle on
both sides. Watch in hand, Miles checked off the minutes,
and exactly at the time appointed he ordered an
advance. The Indians set fire to the dry grass, which was
not yet covered with snow, and the battle was joined
amid clouds of flame and smoke. Although outnumbered
nearly three to one, the attack of the soldiers was pressed
home so relentlessly that the Indians were driven back
from their camp, which fell into the possession of Miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sioux were not beaten, however, for the discomfited
warriors rallied a force to protect their flying women
and children, under the leadership of Gall and
others, Sitting Bull not being as much of a fighter as a
talker. They were led to the attack again and again by
their intrepid chiefs. On one occasion, so impetuous
was their gallantry that the troops were forced to form
square to repel their wild charges. Before the battle
was over—and it continued into the next day—the Indians
had been driven headlong for over forty miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had suffered a serious loss in warriors, but a
greater in the destruction of their camp equipage, winter
supplies, and other property. Two thousand of them
came in on the third day and surrendered, under promises
of good treatment. Several hundred broke into
small parties and scattered. Miles’ little force was too
small to be divided to form a guard for the Indians who
had been captured; and besides, he had other things
to do, so he detained a number of the principal chiefs as
hostages, and exacted promises from the rest that they
would surrender at the Spotted Tail or Red Cloud Agency—a
promise which, by the way, the great majority of
them kept. Sitting Bull, Gall, and about four hundred
others refused to surrender, and made for the boundary
line, escaping pursuit for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>This was the first and most serious defection from the
Indian Confederacy. It was followed by others. In a
subsequent campaign, in the depth of winter, a battalion
under Lieutenant Baldwin struck Sitting Bull’s depleted
and starving camp on two separate occasions, inflicting
further loss upon that implacable chieftain.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c007'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. Miles’ Crushing Defeat of Crazy Horse at Wolf Mountain</h4>

<p class='c020'>Late in December Miles, having practically eliminated
Sitting Bull from the game, moved out against Crazy
Horse. He had with him five companies of the Fifth
Infantry and two of the Twenty-second, in all four hundred
and thirty-six officers and men and two Napoleon
guns. These guns were fitted with canvas wagon-tops,
and were so disguised as exactly to resemble the supply
wagons of the train. The men left the cantonment on
the 29th of December, 1876. It had been learned that
Crazy Horse was in the valley of the Tongue River,
south of the Yellowstone. There were sharp skirmishes
on the first and third of January between the advance
and war parties of Indians, who were moving gradually
up the Tongue toward the mountains. On the evening
of the 7th of January, 1877, a young warrior and a woman
were captured, belonging to those Cheyennes who
were still with Crazy Horse and the Unkpapas, and were
related to some of the principal members of the band.
From them much was learned of the situation of the
Indian position.</p>

    <div>SOME FAMOUS INDIAN FIGHTERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The next morning, the weather being bitterly cold, the
men moved out to attack the Indian camp. Crazy
Horse’s warriors numbered between eight and nine hundred.
He had posted his men on the cliffs surmounting
a valley in the Wolf Mountains, a spur of the Big Horn
Range, not far from Crook’s battle-ground on the Rosebud.
The troops entered the valley in full view of the
Indians occupying the heights. The position was well
chosen; for in order to make the attack, the soldiers
would have to climb straight up the walls to get at the
Indians, who were enabled, by the configuration of the
ground and by their numbers, almost to surround the
soldiers. One reason why Crazy Horse was willing to
fight was because of his great desire to get possession of
the Indians recently captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that Crazy Horse was willing to accept battle,
Miles made his preparations deliberately. The troops,
out of range of the Indians, calmly had breakfast and
made their camp secure. Having done everything at
his leisure, Miles moved out to the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sioux were plainly visible on the cliffs. They
could be seen shaking their fists and brandishing their
rifles as the soldiers slowly advanced through the deep
snow which covered the ground. The Indians seemed
absolutely confident that Miles was marching into a trap,
that when he got into the cañon he would be unable to
scale the slopes, and they would have him at their mercy.
There was no ambush about it. The whole thing was
open and plain. They had chosen their position and
had invited the soldiers to make at them. There was,
indeed, no other way for Miles to get to them, so cunningly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>had they taken advantage of the ground, except
the way which lay open before them. As the troops
drew nearer, the gestures of defiance and contempt were
accompanied by yells and jeers. Among the things
they shouted in their confident assurance of success were
these significant words:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have had your last breakfast!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, the grim prophecy did not seem unlikely of
fulfilment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might have been supposed that men, encumbered as
were the soldiers with their heavy, winter clothing, could
never have scaled those heights, especially in the face of
such opposition as the redoubtable warriors of Crazy
Horse would offer. If they did not succeed in clearing
the cliffs of the Indians, they would probably be shot
down in scores in the valley. They would then be forced
to retreat to their train, if any of them were left alive to do
so, and stand a siege; and as they were three or four hundred
miles from any possible relieving force, and in the
depth of a Dakota winter, that would mean a speedy annihilation.
It was a serious risk to take, but no battle
was ever won without taking risks, and the nice art of the
soldier consists in knowing what risks to take and when
to take them. Not the least of Miles’ claims to admiration
as a commander was his determination, under all
circumstances, to fight then and there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Undaunted by the threatening prospect and unmoved
by the savage shouts and jeers, although some of the
scouts who knew the Sioux language retorted in kind,
the troops deployed, and at as rapid a pace as they could
manage, started for the hills. The artillery was exposed
and unlimbered, and the shells thrown into the
Indian position caused great surprise and consternation.
The key to the position was a high elevation upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>left. The Indians who held it were led by Big Crow,
the chief medicine man. As the battle began he exposed
himself freely between the lines, dressed in a magnificent
Indian war shirt and bonnet, running up and down
and yelling like a fiend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miles massed a little column against Big Crow and
the warriors defending the eminence. At the same
time he ordered a general escalade of the cliff along the
whole line. Under a heavy fire, which, however, like
most plunging fires down the sides of mountains or
slopes, did but little damage, the troops slowly toiled up
the icy, snow-covered bluffs.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c007'><sup>[105]</sup></a> Led by Major Casey
and Captains McDonald and Baldwin, the charge was
delivered with the utmost resolution. It was not a dash.
No men, encumbered as were those soldiers, could move
rapidly up icy cliffs, covered, wherever the sharpness
of the acclivity permitted, with from one to three feet of
snow. It was rather a slow, dogged, determined crawl,
with a stop every few moments to fire at some Indian
silhouetted above them on the gray sky-line of that winter
morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fighting for the high cliff on the left of the line
was spirited and desperate. Finally, the men came to a
hand-to-hand struggle. The Indians clung tenaciously
to the post until Big Crow was shot, when the soldiers
succeeded in dislodging them. This bluff commanded
the lines. It was occupied by the troops, who poured an
enfilading fire upon the army of Crazy Horse. The Indian
position, therefore, became untenable, and fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>sullenly and stubbornly, they withdrew in good order,
though closely pursued by the troops. In the latter
part of the advance snow began to fall, and before the
battle was closed the combatants were fighting in the
midst of a blinding storm. Miles says that the moment
at which the Indians turned their backs and began the
retreat was one in which he felt relief scarcely to be expressed,
so desperate had been the fighting, so difficult
the ascent, and so doubtful the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians were pursued for some distance, and a
large portion of their camp equipage, with supplies, was
captured. On the whole, they had suffered a most disheartening
and disorganizing defeat. Their ammunition
was about gone, their confederates in other tribes
had been captured, the main body of the redoubtable
Cheyennes had been crushed and were starving, the
Unkpapas, the Miniconjous, the Sans Arcs, and the
Brulés had surrendered. The game was up. There
was nothing for Crazy Horse and the exhausted remnant
which remained faithful to him to do but to surrender,
which they accordingly did in the early spring.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. The Capture of Lame Deer’s Village</h4>

<p class='c020'>There remained, then, in the field practically but one
band of sixty lodges,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c007'><sup>[106]</sup></a> under Lame Deer and Iron Star,
who refused positively to surrender. The indefatigable
and brilliantly successful Miles pursued this band, overtook
it, surprised it one morning in May, captured the
village, dispersed the greater portion of the Indians, and
succeeded in isolating and surrounding Lame Deer and
Iron Star, with half a dozen principal warriors. Miles
was very desirous of taking them alive. He advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>with some of his officers toward the desperate little body
of Indians who had been cut off from the fleeing mass of
savages, making peace signs and crying peace words.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians were tremendously excited and remained
on guard, but committed no act of hostility. Miles rode
up, and leaning over the saddle, extended his hand to
Lame Deer. The intrepid chieftain, who was quivering
with emotion under his Indian stoicism, grasped the
general’s hand and clung to it tightly. Iron Star took
Baldwin’s hand. The other Indians came forward,
reluctantly, with hands extended, and all was going
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this juncture one of the white scouts, not knowing
what was going on, dashed up to the group, and possibly
under a misapprehension that the life of the commanding
officer was threatened, covered Lame Deer
with his rifle. The Indian, probably thinking that he
was to be killed in any event, resolved to die fighting.
Miles strove to hold him and to reassure him, but by a
powerful wrench he freed himself, lifting his rifle as he
did so, and pointing it straight at the general.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miles had been in many battles, but he was never
nearer death than at that moment. His quickness and
resource did not desert him. Just as the Indian’s finger
pressed the trigger he dug his spurs into his horse and
swung the animal aside in a powerful swerve. Lame
Deer’s bullet, which missed him by a hair’s breadth,
struck one of the escort and instantly killed him. Iron
Star also drew away from Baldwin and raised his rifle,
as the other Indian had done. None of them were so
quick, however, as Lame Deer had been. The soldiers
closing in had seen Lame Deer’s motion, and before any
further damage was done by the Indians they were overwhelmed
by a rapid fire, which stretched them all dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>upon the ground. The fighting had been short, but
exceedingly sharp. The troops lost four killed and
seven wounded, the Sioux fourteen killed and a large
number wounded. The band was completely broken
up, and most of the Indians surrendered soon after.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c007'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of all the Indians who had borne prominent parts in
this greatest of our Indian wars with the savage tribes,
there remained at large only the indomitable Sitting
Bull, and he had escaped capture because, with a
wretched band of starving but resolute followers, he
succeeded in crossing the British Columbia boundary
line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crook’s persistence, Mills’ bold stroke, Mackenzie’s
desperate dash up Willow Creek Cañon, Miles’ splendid
campaigning, his hard fighting at Cedar Creek and Wolf
Mountain, his pursuit of Lame Deer, his policy and skill
in dealing with the critical situations which had arisen,
at last brought peace to the blood-drenched land. The
most important work ever done by the United States
Army outside of the greater wars of the nation had been
successfully and brilliantly accomplished.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. Farewell to a Great Chief and His Hopes</h4>

<p class='c020'>A note of the fate of the two chief antagonists of the
United States may fittingly close this chapter. Sitting
Bull returned to the United States, and surrendered to
the army a few years later. Ever a malcontent, he was
one of the moving spirits in the Ghost Dance uprising,
which culminated in the battle of Wounded Knee in
1890, and he was killed by the Indian police while resisting
arrest.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c007'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The end of Crazy Horse came sooner, in a mêlée in a
guard-house on the 7th of September, 1877. He was
stabbed in the abdomen, and died from the effects of the
wound. He was dissatisfied always, in spite of his surrender,
and had been conspiring to take the war-path
again. Believing that his intentions had become known
and that he would be rigorously dealt with on account
of the discovery, he started to run amuck, with a knife
of which he had become possessed by some means, in the
guard-house. When the fracas was over, he was found
on the ground, with a desperate wound in the abdomen.
Whether the wound was given by the bayonet of the sentry
at the door, whether the blow was delivered by some
of the Indians who threw themselves upon him, and with
whom he struggled, is a matter which cannot be determined.
However it was come by, it was enough, for
from the effects he died in a short time.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that was the melancholy end of Crazy Horse, the
protagonist of these tales, and one of the most famous
Indians that ever lived. Captain Bourke<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c007'><sup>[109]</sup></a> thus describes
him:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw before me a man who looked quite young, not
over thirty years old, five feet eight inches high, lithe and
sinewy, with a scar in the face. The expression of his
countenance was one of quiet dignity, but morose,
dogged, tenacious, and melancholy. He behaved with
stolidity, like a man who realized that he had to give in
to Fate, but would do so as sullenly as possible....
All Indians gave him a high reputation for courage and
generosity. In advancing upon an enemy, none of his
warriors were allowed to pass him. He had made himself
hundreds of friends by his charity toward the poor, as
it was a point of honor with him never to keep anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>for himself, excepting weapons of war. I never heard
an Indian mention his name save in terms of respect. In
the Custer Massacre, the attack by Reno had first caused
a panic among the women and children and some of the
warriors, who started to flee; but Crazy Horse, throwing
away his rifle, brained one of the incoming soldiers with
his stone war-club, and jumped upon his horse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Crazy Horse was a born soldier, whose talents for warfare
and leadership were of the highest order. He had
repulsed Reynolds on the Powder River, wresting a victory
from apparent defeat. He had thrown himself in
succession upon the columns of Crook on the Rosebud
and of Custer on the Little Big Horn; and it must be admitted
that he had not only checked, but had driven
back, Crook by a crushing attack upon him, while he had
annihilated half of Custer’s command. He had fought
a desperate, and, from a military point of view,
highly creditable, action with Crook’s vastly superior
forces at Slim Buttes. The only man who had fairly
and squarely defeated him was Miles at Wolf Mountain,
and even there Crazy Horse managed to keep his
force well in hand as he withdrew from the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would probably never have surrendered, had it not
been for the defections around him, and for the disastrous
defeat of the Cheyennes by Mackenzie, and the
destruction of so much of his camp equipage at Wolf
Mountain. As it was, he might have continued the
fighting, had not his warriors been freezing and starving,
and almost entirely out of ammunition. There was
nothing left for the Indians but surrender. As one of
them said to Miles:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are poor compared with you and your force. We
cannot make a rifle, a round of ammunition, or a knife.
In fact, we are at the mercy of those who are taking possession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of our country. Your terms are harsh and
cruel, but we are going to accept them, and place ourselves
at your mercy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That summed up the situation, although the terms
granted the Indians were very far from being harsh or
cruel.</p>

<p class='c000'>So passed out of history the great war chief of the
Sioux, one of the bravest of the brave, and one of the
most capable and sagacious of captains in spite of his
absurd name. He had many of the vices, perhaps all the
vices, of his race; but he had all their rude virtues, too,
and great abilities, which most of them lacked. Sitting
Bull, wise, crafty, indomitable as he was, was not to be
compared with him for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a tragedy any way you look at it. You cannot
but feel much admiration for those Sioux and Cheyennes—cruel,
ruthless though they were. I bid good-by
to them with a certain regret.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some one has said, as the Rosebud and the Little Big
Horn marked the high-water of Indian supremacy in
the Northwest, so the forgotten grave of Crazy Horse
marks an ebb from which no tide has ever risen.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he passes to the happy hunting-ground in the land
of the Great Spirit, I stand and salute him with a feeling
of respect which I have gathered not only from a study
of his career, but from the statements and writings of
men who could best judge of his qualities—for they were
the soldiers who fought him.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>NOTES ON THE LAME DEER FIGHT</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c028'>
    <div>By Colonel D. L. Brainard, U. S. A.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c007'><sup>[110]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The command, consisting of four troops of the Second Cavalry,
“F,” “G,” “H,” and “L,” two companies of the Fifth Infantry, two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>of the Twenty-second Infantry, and a company of mounted scouts, all
under command of Colonel Nelson A. Miles, left the cantonment on
Tongue River May 1, 1877, and marched up Tongue River, with a
view of intercepting a band of hostile Indians, under Lame Deer,
known to be at or near the head-waters of the Rosebud River. The
transportation consisted of bull teams, mule teams, and a few pack
animals. The command marched up Tongue River four days, when
the train was left in charge of a small guard, the main command pushing
on with pack trains, the cavalry leading and the infantry following
more slowly, striking across country toward the Rosebud River,
marching day and night, stopping only long enough to make coffee for
the men, and to rest and graze the animals.</p>

<p class='c022'>We bivouacked on the evening of the 6th in a deep valley near Little
Muddy Creek, and about two o’clock the following morning were
again in the saddle, moving silently and swiftly down the valley toward
the Indian camp, which had been located the previous evening by
White Bull, Brave Wolf, Bob Jackson, and the other scouts. The scouts
had reported that the camp was only about six miles distant, but it was
soon discovered that it was much farther than this, and at early dawn
we were still some distance away. The command had been moving at
a trot, but the gallop was immediately taken up, and just as the sun appeared
above the horizon, we rounded a bend in the valley and came in
sight of the Indian camp, which was located on the right side, close to
the hills.</p>

<p class='c022'>At first we saw no Indians except a few boys guarding the ponies,
which were grazing a little distance beyond the camp, but they came
out immediately, and dropping in the grass, began to fire in our direction,
though without effect. As we charged down on the camp, these
Indians, together with squaws and children, ran for the hills, driving
with them the few horses that were near the tepees. “H” Company,
under command of Lieutenant Lovell H. Jerome, charged through the
camp and beyond, capturing the pony herd. The other companies, all
under command of Captain Ball, charged to the village, formed line to
the right, deployed as skirmishers, and pursued the Indians up the
hill.</p>

<p class='c022'>The hills were so steep at this point that it was necessary to dismount
the command and advance on foot, the horses being sent around by an
easier route to join us later near the summit of the hill. The line as
formed was “F” troop (Tyler) on the right, “L” troop (Norwood)
center, and “G” troop (Wheelan) on the left. The Indians were
driven up over the hills, where they scattered like quail. Our horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>were brought up, and mounting, we charged across the country for
two or three miles, and later returned to the village.</p>

<p class='c022'>As my recollections serve me, four soldiers and fourteen Indians
were killed, ten soldiers being wounded, myself being one of the number.
About four hundred ponies were captured, which were afterward
used for mounting a battalion of Infantry, which later performed
much effective work in the field. There were over sixty tepees, in
which we found tons of dried buffalo meat, a few arms, some ammunition,
and a great many buffalo robes, saddles, and an assortment of
camp property, all of which were burned that afternoon, thus so effectually
crippling the band that the remnant came in and surrendered a
few weeks later.</p>

<p class='c022'>We camped on the battle-ground that night, the following day moving
back in the direction of our wagon train.</p>

<p class='c022'>One of the most interesting incidents of the fight occurred just as the
troop to which I belonged (“L”) charged on the village. I saw General
Miles riding toward the first tepee, near which were two Indians,
followed by his orderly. He called out something to these Indians
which I did not understand, but I later understood he had called on
them to surrender. One of these was evidently the Chief, Lame Deer,
for he wore a long head-dress of eagle feathers, the head-dress reaching
to the ground. As Miles approached on horseback, the Chief walked
rapidly toward him, with his hand extended, as though to shake hands,
but when within ten or twelve feet of him, the Indian in the rear, who
was said to be Iron Star, a son of Lame Deer, and also a medicine man
of the tribe, called sharply to Lame Deer, presumably warning him of
the approaching troops, and urging him to follow the other Indians to
the hills.</p>

<p class='c022'>Lame Deer stopped, turned, hesitated, then ran back a few steps,
and picking up a loaded carbine from the ground, fired point blank at
General Miles, who, seeing the movement, wheeled his horse sharply
and bent forward. The bullet passed over him, striking his orderly
in the breast, killing him instantly. The Chief then ran up the steep
hill, accompanied by the other Indian. The head-dress made a very
conspicuous mark, and many shots were immediately fired in that direction.
From his tottering steps we saw that the Chief was badly
wounded, and at this point his companion, instead of escaping as he
could have done, placed his arm around the Chief’s waist, and supported
him up the hill. About this time the Chief drew a revolver, and
without turning about, held it in rear of him and fired in our direction,
the bullets striking the ground only a few feet in his rear. This act,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>we assumed, was one of defiance of a man who knew he could not escape,
but who was game to the last. Iron Star supported the Chief
until the latter fell, when he escaped over the hill, only to be killed by
“G” troop, which had been pushing up on that side. After the devotion
and bravery he had displayed in supporting Lame Deer up the hill,
we were almost sorry he had not escaped alive.</p>

<p class='c022'>A few days later Bob Jackson told me that, on examining Lame
Deer’s body after the fight, he had found that he had been hit seventeen
times.</p>

<p class='c022'>Another incident which illustrates the valor of the United States
soldier was that of Private Leonard, Troop “L,” Second Cavalry, who
had dropped behind to readjust his saddle, a couple of miles from the
Indian camp. The command was moving rapidly, and the Indians
slipped in between the rear of the column and this lone soldier. However,
when he saw them he rode to the top of a hill, and lying down
behind some rocks, held these Indians at bay for several hours until relief
came to him. It was fortunate that relief came as it did, for he had
nearly exhausted his ammunition in firing at these Indians, who had
several times charged his position.</p>

private letter, afterward made public, of the orders he received: “When I was given
command of this battalion opposite the mouth of Squaw Creek, and the General took
command of a less number of men, it was a question as to which would find the hostile
Indians, and with the only order or suggestion given by him in that earnest manner characteristic
of him, he said, ‘Now, Baldwin, do the best you can. I am responsible for
disaster, success will be to your credit; you know what my plans are, and what we are
here for.’” There is a dashing, manly ring about such words which I rejoice to recognize.
It is a great soldier who can first choose and then trust his subordinates.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r105'>105</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At the battle of King’s Mountain, in the American Revolution, the small loss of life
among the Americans was due to the fact that the English, trained marksmen though
they were, firing down the slopes of the mountain, overshot their opponents, although
they had them in full view all the way up the slope; and it is the tendency of troops
always to do the same thing. Troops on a level usually fire too low, and the ground
between the advancing lines of soldiers is often plowed up by bullets from the depressed
muzzles, which should have gone into the breasts of the approaching enemy.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER TWELVE<br /> <span class='large'>What They Are There For A Sketch of General Guy V. Henry, a Typical American Soldier</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I. Savage Warfare</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>The most thankless task that can be undertaken
by a nation is warfare against savage or
semi-civilized peoples. In it there is usually
little glory; nor is there any reward, save the
consciousness of disagreeable duty well performed. The
risk to the soldier is greater than in ordinary war, since
the savages usually torture the wounded and the captured.
Success can only be achieved by an arduous,
persistent, wearing down process, which affords little
opportunity for scientific fighting, yet which demands
military talents of the highest order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost anybody can understand the strategy or the
tactics of a pitched battle where the number engaged
is large, the casualties heavy, and the results decisive;
but very few non-professional critics appreciate a campaign
of relentless pursuit by a small army of a smaller
body of mobile hostiles, here and there capturing a
little band, now and then killing or disabling a few,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>until in the final round-up the enemy, reduced to perhaps
less than a score, surrenders. There is nothing
spectacular about the performance, and everybody wonders
why it took so long.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as injustice and wrong have not been infrequent
in the preliminary dealings between the government
and the savages, the soldier, who has only to obey his
orders, comes in for much unmerited censure from those
who think darkly though they speak bitterly. Especially
is he criticized if, when maddened by the suffering,
the torture, of some comrade, the soldier sinks to the
savage level in his treatment of his ruthless foeman.
No one justifies such a lapse, of course, but few there be
who even try to understand it. The incessant campaigning
in the Philippines, with its resulting scandals,
is an instance in point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before the Spanish-American War and its
Philippine corollary, however, our little army had shown
itself capable of the hardest and most desperate campaigning
against the Indians of the West—as difficult
and dangerous a work as any army ever undertook.
There was so much of it, and it abounded with so many
thrilling incidents, that volumes could be written upon
it without exhausting its tragedy, its romance. There
were few soldiers who served beyond the Mississippi
from 1865 to 1890 who did not participate in a score
of engagements, whose lives were not in peril more
than once in many a hard, but now forgotten, campaign.</p>

    <div>GROUP OF DISTINGUISHED INDIAN FIGHTERS</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>All except General Henry from contemporary photographs</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>One of the bravest of our Indian fighters was Guy
V. Henry. Personally, he was a typical representative
of the knightly American soldier. Officially, it was his
fortune to perform conspicuous services in at least three
expeditions subsequent to the Civil War. He was a
West Pointer, and the son of another, born in the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>at Fort Smith in the Indian Territory. Graduating in
1861, a mere boy, he participated in four years of the
hardest fighting in the Civil War, from Bull Run to Cold
Harbor. At the age of twenty-three, his merit won him
the appointment of Colonel of the Fortieth Massachusetts
Volunteers, “a regiment that was never whipped.”
The tall, brawny Yankees fairly laughed at the beardless
stripling who was appointed to command them. “They
laugh best who laugh last,” and Henry had the last
laugh. He mastered them, and to this day they love
his memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was thrice mentioned in despatches, and brevetted
five times for conspicuous gallantry in action during
the war, out of which he came with the rank of brigadier-general.
For heroic and successful fighting at Old
Cold Harbor, he received the highest distinction that
can come to a soldier, the medal of honor. Having
two horses shot from under him in the attack upon the
Confederate lines, he seized a third from a trooper,
mounted him under a withering fire, and led his soldiers
forward in a final assault, which captured the enemy’s
intrenchments; this third horse was shot under him
just as he leaped the breastworks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thin as a shoestring and as brave as a lion,” he was
a past-master of military tactics and a severe disciplinarian.
“I tell you he is a martinet,” cried one young
officer angrily, smarting under a well-deserved reproof.
“You are wrong,” replied a wiser officer, who knew
Henry better; “he is trying to make your own record
better than you could ever make it yourself.” Sudden
as a thunderbolt and swift as a hawk when he struck the
red Sioux, in his family and social relations he was a
kindly, considerate, Christian gentleman. He could kill
Indians—but never cruelly, mercilessly, only in open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>warfare—and teach a class in Sunday-school. I’ve seen
him do the latter, and no man did it better; the boys of
his class simply idolized him. And his men in the army
did the same. Cool and tactful, a statesman, for all his
fiery energy, he was perhaps the best of our colonial
governors. When he died the people of Porto Rico
mourned him as a friend, where the little children had
loved him as a father.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II. A March in a Blizzard</h4>

<p class='c020'>At the close of the Civil War he was transferred to
the Third Cavalry, a regiment with which he was
destined to win lasting renown. It must have been
hard for men who had exercised high command, and
who had proved their fitness for it, to come down from
general officers to subalterns; but Henry accepted the
situation cheerfully. He was as proud of his troop of
cavalry as he had been of his regiment and brigade of
volunteers. His new detail took him to Arizona, where
for two years he commanded a battalion engaged in
hard scouting among the Apaches. The winter of 1874
found him at Fort Robinson in the Black Hills. While
there he was ordered to go into the Bad Lands to remove
certain miners who were supposed to be there in defiance
of treaty stipulations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after Christmas, with his own troop and fifteen
men of the Ninth Infantry under Lieutenant Carpenter,
with wagons, rations, and forage for thirty days,
the men set forth. The expedition involved a march
of three hundred miles, over the worst marching country
on the face of the globe, and in weather of unimaginable
severity, the cold continually ranging from twenty
to forty degrees below zero. The miners were not found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and on the return journey the command, which had suffered
terrible hardships, was overtaken by a blizzard.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, in an Eastern city, the thermometer gets down
to the zero mark, and it blows hard, with a heavy snow
for twenty-four hours, people who are not familiar with
the real article call such insignificant weather manifestations
a blizzard. Imagine a fierce gale sweeping
down from the north, filled with icy needles which draw
blood ere they freeze the naked skin, the thermometer
forty degrees below zero, a rolling, treeless country without
shelter of any sort from the blinding snow and the
biting wind, and you have the situation in which that
expedition found itself. The storm came up an hour
after breaking camp on what was hoped to be the last
day on the return journey. To return to the place of
the camp was impossible. To keep moving was the
only thing to be done. The cold was so intense that
it was at first deemed safer to walk than ride. The
troops dismounted and struggled on. Many of the men
gave out and sank exhausted, but were lifted to their
saddles and strapped there, Henry himself doing this
with his own hands. Finally, the whole party got so
weak that it was impossible for them to proceed. In
desperation, they mounted the exhausted horses and
urged them forward. Henry had no knowledge of
direction, but trusted to the instincts of his horse. He
led the way. Many of the men had to be beaten to
keep them awake and alive—to sleep was death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, when hope and everything else was abandoned,
they came to a solitary ranch under the curve of
a hill, occupied by a white man and his Indian wife.
They were saved; that is, they had escaped with their
lives. The horses were put in shelter in the corral, the
men crowded into the house, and the painful process of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>thawing out was begun. The ranch was fifteen miles
from Fort Robinson, and when the blizzard abated the
next day wagons and ambulances were sent out, and the
helpless soldiers were carried back to the post.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of them were in a terrible condition, and few
had escaped. They were broken from the hardships they
had undergone, especially from the freezing, which
those who have suffered from declare causes a prostration
from which it is difficult to recover. When Henry
entered his quarters his wife did not recognize him.
His face was black and swollen. His men cut the
bridle reins to free his hands, and then slit his gloves
into strips, each strip bringing a piece of flesh as it was
pulled off. All his fingers were frozen to the second
joint; the flesh sloughed off, exposing the bones. One
finger had to be amputated, and to the day of his death
his left hand was so stiff that he was unable to close
his fingers again. As he was a thin, spare man, with no
superfluous flesh, he had suffered more than the rest.
Yet he made no complaint, and it was only due to his
indomitable persistence that the men were not frozen
to death that awful day. Henry’s winter march is still
remembered, by those in the old service, as one of the
heroic achievements of the period.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>III. A Ghastly Experience</h4>

<p class='c020'>The heroism and sufferings of the young soldier were
nothing, however, to what he manifested and underwent
two years later. Just before the Custer Massacre,
General Crook, with some eleven hundred men, moved
out from Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, on the expedition
that culminated in the battle of the Rosebud. Colonel
W. B. Royall had command of the cavalry of Crook’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>little army. One morning in June the Sioux and the
Cheyennes, under Crazy Horse, who as a fighter and
general was probably second to few Indians that ever
lived, attacked Crook’s men. The left wing, under
Royall, was isolated in a ravine and practically surrounded
by a foe who outnumbered them five to one.
The rest of the army, heavily engaged, could give them
no succor. The Indians made charge after charge
upon the troops, who had all dismounted except the
field officers. Henry had command of the left battalion
of Royall’s force. Cool as an iceberg, he rode
up and down the thin line, steadying and holding his
men. At one time, by a daring charge, he rescued an
imperiled company under a brother officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last, in one of the furious attacks of the Sioux, he
was shot in the face. A rifle bullet struck him under
the left eye, passed through the upper part of his mouth
under the nose, and came out below the right eye. The
shock was terrific. His face was instantly covered
with blood, his mouth filled with it. He remained in the
saddle, however, and strove to urge the troops on. In
the very act of spurring his horse forward to lead a
charge, he lost consciousness, and fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that instant the war-bonneted Indians, superbly
mounted, delivered an overwhelming onslaught on the
left flank of the line. The men, deprived of their
leader, for a time gave back. The Indians actually
galloped over the prostrate figure of the brave soldier.
Fortunately, he was not struck by the hoofs of any of the
horses. A determined stand by Chief Washakie, of the
friendly Shoshones, our Indian allies in that battle,
who with two or three of his braves fought desperately
over Henry’s body, prevented him from being scalped
and killed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>The officers of the Third speedily rallied their men,
drove back the Indians, and reoccupied the ground
where Henry lay. He was assisted to his horse and
taken to the rear where the surgeons were. Such was
the nature of his wound that he could not speak above
a whisper; he could not see at all, he could scarcely
hear, and he had great difficulty in breathing. As the
doctor bent over him he heard the wounded man mumble
out, “Fix me up so that I can go back!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no going back for him that day. Through
the long day he lay on the ground while the battle raged
about him. There was little water and no shelter;
there wasn’t a tent in the army. Although it was
bitter cold during the nights in that country at that season,
at midday it was fearfully hot. He was consumed
with thirst. His orderly managed to give him a little
shade by holding his horse so that the shadow of the
animal’s body fell upon the wounded man. His wound
was dressed temporarily as well as possible, and then
he was practically left to die.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the colonel’s comrades came back to him during
a lull in the fight. There he lay helpless on the
bare ground, in the shadow of the restive horse, which
the orderly had all he could do to manage. No one
else could be spared from the battle line to attend to
Henry’s wants, although, as a matter of fact, he expressed
no wants. The flies had settled thickly upon
his bandaged face. The officer bent over him with an
expression of commiseration.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all right, Jack,” gurgled out from the bleeding
lips; “it’s what we’re here for.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c007'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Royall’s forces were finally able to effect a junction
with the main body by withdrawing fighting, and Henry
was carried along any way in the hurried movement.
The Indians at last withdrew from the field (the battle
must be considered a drawn one), and then there
was time to consider what was to be done with the
wounded. The facilities for treatment were the slenderest.
The column had been stripped of its baggage, in
order to increase its mobility, to enable it to cope with
the Indians. All they had they carried on their persons,
and that included little but the barest necessities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody expected Henry to survive the night. He
didn’t expect to live himself, as he lay there through
the long hours, listening to the men digging graves for
those who had fallen, and wondering whether or not
he was to be one of the occupants thereof. The next
day they sent him to the rear. He was transported in
what is called a travois. Two saplings were cut from
the river bank; two army mules, one at each end, were
placed between the saplings, which were slung over the
backs of the animals. An army blanket, or piece of
canvas, was then lashed to the poles, and on them
the sufferer was placed. There were a number of
wounded—none of them, however, so seriously as
Henry. It was some two hundred miles to Fort Fetterman,
and they carried him all that distance that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weather at night was bitterly cold. In the daytime
it was burning hot. The travois was so short—they
had to take what poles they could get, of course—that
several times the head of the rear mule hit the
wounded officer’s head, so that finally they turned him
about, putting his head behind the heels of the foremost
animal, where he was liable to be kicked to death at
any moment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>On one occasion one of the mules stumbled and fell
and pitched Henry out upon his head. The officers of
the little escort stood aghast as they saw him fall out;
but it is a matter of record, solemnly attested, that such
was Henry’s iron self-control that he made no sound,
although the agony was excruciating. In fact, on the
whole journey he made no complaint of any sort. His
only food was broth, which was made from birds shot
by the soldiers as they came upon them, and he got this
very infrequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, the little cortège reached Fort Fetterman.
The last mishap awaited them there. The river was
crossed by a ferryboat, which was pulled from shore to
shore by ropes and tackles. The river was very high
and the current running swiftly, and as they prepared
to take the wounded officer across, the ropes broke,
and the whole thing went to pieces, leaving him within
sight, but not within reach, of clean beds, comforts,
and medical attention he hoped to secure. Some of the
escort, rough soldiers though they were, broke into
tears as they saw the predicament of their beloved officer.
He himself, however, true to his colors, said
nothing. Finally, they offered to take him across the
raging torrent in a small skiff—the only boat available—if
he were willing to take the risk. Of course,
if the skiff were overturned, he would have been
drowned. He took the risk, and with two men to
paddle and an officer to hold him in his arms, the passage
was made.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV. An Army Wife</h4>

<p class='c020'>Three hundred miles away, at Fort D. A. Russell,
his wife was waiting for him. Long before he reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Fort Fetterman, she heard through couriers the news
of his wound, which was reported to her as fatal, although
he had taken care to cause a reassuring message
to be sent her with the first messenger. With the
heroism of the army wife, although she was in delicate
health at the time, she immediately made preparations
to join him. The railroad at that time ran as far as
Medicine Bow. Beyond that there was a hundred-mile
ride to Fort Fetterman. All the troops were in the
field; none could be spared from the nominal garrisons
for an escort. Again and again Mrs. Henry made
preparations to go forward, several times actually starting,
and again and again she was forbidden to do so by
the officers in command at the various posts. It was
not safe to send a woman across the country with a
few soldiers; the Indians were up and out in all directions.
There was no safety anywhere outside the
forts or larger towns; she had to stay at home and
wait. Sometimes the devoted wife got word from her
husband, sometimes she did not. The savages were
constantly cutting the wires. Her suspense was agonizing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, the arrival of troops at Fort Fetterman enabled
a stronger escort to be made up, and Henry was
sent down to Fort D. A. Russell. The troops arrived
at Medicine Bow on the third of July. The train did
not leave until the next day. They were forced to go
into camp. The cowboys and citizens celebrated the
Fourth in the usual manner. That night the pain-racked
man narrowly escaped being killed by the reckless
shooting of the celebrators. Two bullets passed
through the tent in which he lay, just above his head.
The next morning found him on the train. His heart
action had been so weakened by chloral and other medicines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>which they had given him, that at Sherman, the
highest point on the journey, he came within an inch of
dying.</p>

<p class='c000'>His thoughts all along had been of his wife. When
he got to the station he refused to get in an ambulance,
in order to spare her the sight of his being brought home
in that way. A carriage was procured, and supported
in the arms of the physician and his comrades, he was
driven back to the fort. With superhuman resolution,
in order to convince his wife that he was not seriously
hurt, he determined to walk from the carriage to the
door. Mrs. Henry had received instructions from the
doctor to control herself, and stood waiting quietly in
the entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” whispered the shattered man, as she took
him tenderly by the hand, alluding to the fact that it
was the Fourth of July, “this is a fine way to celebrate,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>After the quietest of greetings—think of that woman,
what her feelings must have been!—he was taken into
the house and laid on the sofa. The doctor had said
that he might have one look at his wife. The bandages
were lifted carefully from his face, so that he might
have that single glance; then they were replaced, and
the wife, unable to bear it longer, fled from the room.
The chaplain’s wife was waiting for her outside the door,
and when she got into the shelter of that good woman’s
arms she gave way and broke down completely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know,” said the chaplain’s wife, alluding to
many conversations which they had had, “that you
asked of God only that He should bring him back to
you, and God has heard that prayer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody expected that Henry would die, but die he
did not; perhaps it would be better to say die he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>not. And he had no physique to back his efforts, only
an indomitable will. He never completely recovered
from that experience. He lost the sight of one eye permanently,
and to the day of his death was liable to a
hemorrhage at any moment, in which there was grave
danger of his bleeding to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took a year’s leave of absence, and then came back
to duty. In 1877, when his troop was ordered to the
front in another campaign under Crook against the
redoubtable Sioux, he insisted upon accompanying
them. He had been out an hour or so when he fell
fainting from the saddle. Did they bring him back?
Oh, no! He bade them lay him under a tree, leave two
or three men with him to look after him, and go ahead.
He would rejoin them that night, when it became cooler
and he could travel with more ease! What he said he
would do he did. A trooper rode back to the post on his
own account and told of his condition. An order was
sent him by the post commander to return. Henry
quietly said he would obey the first order and go on.
He remained with the troop for six weeks, until finally
he was picked up bodily and carried home, vainly
protesting, the doctor refusing to answer either for
his eyesight or for his life if he stayed in the field
any longer.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>V. The Buffalos and Their Famous Ride</h4>

<p class='c020'>Thirteen years after that Henry was commanding the
Ninth Cavalry, with headquarters at Fort McKinney.
The Ninth Cavalry was a regiment of negroes. From
the overcoats which they wore in Wyoming in the winter
they were called the “Buffalos,” and sometimes they
were facetiously referred to as “Henry’s Brunettes.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Whatever they were called, they were a regiment of
which to be proud.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1890 occurred the last outbreak of the Sioux under
the inspiration of the Ghost Dancers, which culminated
in the battle of Wounded Knee. Troops from all over
the United States were hurried to the Pine Ridge
Agency as the trouble began. On the 24th of December
Henry and the “Brunettes” were ordered out to the
former’s old stamping ground in the Black Hills on a
scouting expedition. It was bitter cold that Christmas
Eve, but, thank God! there was no blizzard. Fifty miles
on the back of a trotting horse was the dose before them.
They rested at four <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the morning of Christmas
Day. Some of the garments the men wore were frozen
stiff. They had broken through the ice of the White
River in crossing it. How the men felt inside the
frozen clothing may be imagined. Eight miles farther
they made their camp. They did not have much of a
Christmas celebration, for as soon as possible after establishing
their base at Harney Springs they went on the
scout. They hunted assiduously for several days, but
found no Indians. These had gone south to join their
brethren concentrated about the agency. One day
they rode forty-two miles in a vain search. They got
back to camp about seven o’clock. At nine a courier
from the agency fifty miles away informed them of the
battle of Wounded Knee, and that five thousand Oglala
Sioux were mustering to attack the agency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Boots and Saddles!” instantly rang out, and the
tired troopers mounted their jaded horses again. This
time the camp was broken for keeps, and tents were
struck, wagons packed to abandon it. It was a bitter
cold night. There was a fierce gale sweeping through
the valley, blowing a light snow in the faces of the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>wrapped to the eyes in their buffalo coats and fur
caps. They pushed steadily on in spite of it, for it was
Henry’s intention to reach the agency in the dark in
order to avoid attack by the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was thought advisable, therefore, to leave the
wagon train under an escort of one company and press
forward with the rest. The men arrived at the agency
at daybreak, completing a ride of over ninety miles in
less than twenty hours. Fires were kindled, horses
picketed, and the exhausted men literally threw themselves
on the ground for rest. They had been there but
a short time when one of the men from the escort came
galloping madly in with the news that the wagon-train
was heavily attacked, and that succor must be sent at
once. Without waiting for orders, without even stopping
to saddle the horses, Henry and his men galloped
back over the road two miles away, where the escort
was gallantly covering the train. A short, sharp skirmish,
in which one man was killed and several wounded,
drove back the Indians, and the regiment brought in
the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was ten o’clock now, and as the negro troops came
into the agency, word was brought that the Drexel
Mission, seven miles up the valley, was being attacked,
and help must be sent immediately. There were two
regiments of cavalry available, the Seventh and the
Ninth. For some unexplained reason, the Ninth was
ordered out. In behalf of his men, Henry made protest.
They must have a little rest, and so the Seventh
was despatched, and was soon hotly engaged. Two
hours later a messenger reported that the Seventh, in
the valley where the mission was situated, was heavily
attacked by the Indians, who had secured commanding
positions on the surrounding ridges. Unless they could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>be relieved, they would probably be overwhelmed.
Again the trumpet call rang out, and the tired black
troopers once more climbed into their saddles and
struck spurs into their more tired horses, galloping away
to the rescue of their hard-pushed white comrades.
The ridges were carried in most gallant style, and after
some sharp fighting the Indians were driven back. The
Seventh was extricated and the day was saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>In thirty-four hours of elapsed time, the Ninth Cavalry
had ridden one hundred and eight miles—the actual
time in the saddle being twenty-two hours. They had
fought two engagements and had rested only two hours.
Marvelous to relate, there wasn’t a sore-backed horse in
the whole regiment. One horse died under the pressure,
but aside from that and their fatigue, horses and men
were in excellent condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was probably the most famous ride ever performed
by troops in the United States. For it Henry
was recommended for a further brevet, as major-general—the
sixth he had received.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spanish-American War was too short to afford
Henry an opportunity to distinguish himself in the field,
but in Porto Rico he showed that his talents were not
merely of the military order. In the brief period his
health permitted him to remain there, he accomplished
wonders, and did it all in such a way as to gain the
respect—nay, the affection—of the people over whom,
with single-hearted devotion and signal capacity, he
ruled. He stayed there until he broke down. I, sick
with typhoid fever on a transport at Ponce, saw him
just before he collapsed. We were old friends, and he
came off to the ship to visit me. I was not too ill then
to realize that his own time was coming. He would
not ask to be relieved.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>“Here I was sent”, he said; “here I will stay until
my duty is done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the knightliest soldier I ever met, and I have
met many. He was one of the humblest Christians I
ever knew, and I have known not a few. It was his
experience at Porto Rico which finally brought about
his death; for it is literally true that he died, as a soldier
should, in his harness. In those trying times at Ponce,
when life and health were at a low ebb, he wrote, in
the sacred confidence of his last letter to his faithful
wife, words which it was not his custom to speak, but
which those of us who knew him felt expressed his
constant thought:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am here alone. One by one my staff officers have
fallen ill and gone home. Home!—let us not speak of
it. Jesus is here with me, and makes even this desolation
home until a brighter one is possible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So, his memory enshrined in the hearts that loved
him, his heroic deeds the inspiration of his fellow-soldiers,
passed to his brighter home Guy V. Henry,
a Captain of the Strong.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'>I.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>Whether General Custer did, or did not, obey General
Terry’s orders; whether these orders were, or were not,
well considered, and such as could be carried out; whether,
if General Custer did disobey General Terry’s orders he was warranted
in so doing by the circumstances in which he found himself,
are questions of the deepest interest to the student of military matters
and the historian thereof. I presume the problem they present will
never be authoritatively settled, and that men will continue to differ
upon these questions until the end of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The matter has been discussed, pro and con, at great length on
many occasions. A number of books and magazine articles have been
written upon different phases of the situation. I have come to the
conclusion indicated in my own article, as I said, against my wish.
In view of his heroic death in the high places of the field, I would fain
hold General Custer, for whom I have long cherished an admiration
which I still retain, entirely innocent. I have only come to this conclusion
after a rigid investigation including the careful weighing of
such evidence as I could secure upon every point in question.</p>

<p class='c000'>This evidence consists, first, of a great variety of printed matter;
second, of personal conversations with soldiers and military critics,
which, as any record of it would necessarily be hearsay and secondhand,
I have not set down hereafter save in one instance; third, of letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>which have been written me by officers who, from their participation
in the campaign, or from unusual opportunities to acquire knowledge
concerning it which they have enjoyed, have become possessed of
information which they were willing to give to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of this appendix is to set down, so that it may be here
preserved in permanent and available form for future reference, such
evidence in these letters as may be pertinent and useful; also to refer
the student, who desires to go deeper into the subject, to some of the
more valuable printed accounts which are easily accessible.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am glad that some of the communications I have received, notably
those from Colonel Godfrey, make a stout defense of General Custer.
Perhaps upon consideration of Colonel Godfrey’s points and arguments,
which are not only strong and well taken, but also admirably
put, the critic may be inclined to differ from my conclusion. For the
sake of General Custer’s fame, I sincerely hope so. I should be glad
to be proved to be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without specifically noting the various descriptions of the campaign
and battle, which are interesting, but irrelevant to my purpose,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c007'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Custer’s
conduct has been critically considered at some length—by persons
whose standing requires that their opinions should be respectfully
received—in several publications which I note in such order as
best serves the purpose of this discussion without regard to the order
in which they appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Edward S. Godfrey,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c007'><sup>[114]</sup></a> U. S. A., now commanding the Ninth
Cavalry, who, as a lieutenant, commanded K Troop, in Benteen’s battalion,
which joined that of Reno in the battle of the 26th of June, 1876,
wrote a most interesting account of the battle, containing some valuable
reflections upon some disputed points, which was published in the
<cite>Century Magazine</cite>, Vol. XLIII., No. 3, January, 1892. To this article,
in the same number, were appended certain comments by Major-General
James B. Fry, U. S. A., since deceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>This article and these comments came to the notice of Major-General
Robert P. Hughes, U. S. A. (retired), then Colonel and Inspector-General.
General Hughes was General Terry’s aide-de-camp during
the Little Big Horn Campaign. He wrote an exhaustive criticism on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Fry’s comments to Godfrey’s article, which was in effect a discussion of
the main proposition that Custer disobeyed his orders and thereby
precipitated the disaster, for which he was therefore responsible. This
campaign was also considered in an article by Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews,
president of the University of Nebraska, who was then president
of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, which appeared
in <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite> for June, 1895. A fuller reference to Dr. Andrews’
position will be made later.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Hughes’ article was offered to the <cite>Century</cite>, but was not accepted,
and was finally published in the <cite>Journal of the Military Service
Institution</cite>, Vol. XVIII., No. 79, January, 1896.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the many books in which the matter has been discussed,
three only call for attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>In “<span class='sc'>The Story of the Soldier</span>,” by Brigadier-General George
A. Forsyth, U. S. A. (retired), the following comment appears:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Under the peculiar condition of affairs, bearing in mind the only
information he could possibly have had concerning Sitting Bull’s
forces, was Custer justified, in a military sense and within the scope
of his orders, in making the attack?</p>

<p class='c022'>“In the opinion of the writer he was within his orders, and fully
justified from a military standpoint in so doing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Forsyth gives no reason for his decision, but it is to be presumed
that he did not arrive at that decision hastily and carelessly,
and as he is a very able and distinguished officer and military critic,
due weight should be accorded his views.</p>

<p class='c000'>In “<span class='sc'>The United States in our Own Time</span>,” by Dr. E. Benjamin
Andrews, published by Chas. Scribner’s Sons, edition of 1903,
pages 190–1–2–3, there is a concise discussion of the question, based on
the article in <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite>, referred to above, with some additional
reflections on General Hughes’ paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>In “<span class='sc'>Personal Recollections of General Nelson A. Miles,
U. S. A.</span>,” chapter xv., pages 198–210, there is a further discussion by
the Lieutenant-General, lately in command of the United States Army.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order clearly to understand what follows the student should refer
to each of the sources mentioned and examine carefully into what is
therein set forth. It is not practicable to quote all these authors at
length. I have corresponded with every one of the authors mentioned
except General Fry. I print their letters to me, having made no
change except once in a while breaking a page into paragraphs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>supplying a missing word here and there which had no especial bearing
upon the point at issue. Some of the letters were written in pencil
amid press of duties. Most of these documents I print without comment.
It is necessary, however, that I should call attention to some
features brought out by the correspondence.</p>

<p class='c000'>President Andrews says, in the book referred to:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Much turns on the force of Custer’s written orders, which, judged
by usual military documents of the kind, certainly gave Custer a much
larger liberty than Colonel Hughes supposed. There is an affidavit of
a witness who heard Terry’s and Custer’s last conversation together at
the mouth of the Rosebud, just before Custer began his fatal ride.
Terry said: ‘Use your own judgment and do what you think best if
you strike the trail; and whatever you do, Custer, hold on to your
wounded.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Miles says, in his book:</p>

<p class='c022'>“But we have positive evidence in the form of an affidavit of the
last witness who heard the two officers in conversation together on the
night before their commands separated, and it is conclusive on the
point at issue. This evidence is that General Terry returned to General
Custer’s tent,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c007'><sup>[115]</sup></a> after giving him the final order, to say to him that
on coming up to the Indians he would have to use his own discretion
and do what he thought best. This conversation occurred at the
mouth of the Rosebud, and the exact words of General Terry, as quoted
by the witness, are:</p>

<p class='c022'>“’Custer, I do not know what to say for the last.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“Custer replied: ‘Say what you want to say.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“Terry then said: ‘Use your own judgment, and do what you
think best if you strike the trail; and, whatever you do, Custer, hold
on to your wounded.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“This was a most reasonable conversation for the two officers under
the circumstances. One had won great distinction as a general in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Civil War; was an able lawyer and department commander, yet entirely
without experience in Indian campaigns. The other had won
great distinction as one of the most gallant and skilful division commanders
of cavalry during the war, commanding one of the most successful
divisions of mounted troops; he had years of experience on the
plains and in handling troops in that remote country, and he had
fought several sharp engagements with hostile Indians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If General Terry spoke such words to General Custer the last thing
before Custer’s departure, those remarks have a very important, almost
a decisive, bearing on the matter at issue. The only question then existing
would be, how far the verbal order ought to be considered as
superseding the written one. <em>It is my opinion that the charge that Custer
disobeyed orders would fall to the ground if the truth of the alleged
remarks could be established.</em> By giving him this verbal order, Terry
would make Custer an absolutely free agent. The vital importance of
establishing this affidavit is therefore obvious.</p>

<p class='c000'>I call attention to the fact that Terry nowhere refers to this conversation,
which it would be incumbent upon a gentleman to declare immediately
Custer was charged with disobeying Terry’s written order,
and that Terry, in that portion of his report which is quoted by me on
page <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>, virtually not only fails to exculpate but actually charges
that Custer did disobey his order, by saying he did the very thing that
he was not expected to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>To establish this affidavit, I wrote to President Andrews, asking his
authority for stating that such an affidavit existed and requesting a
copy of it. Here is his reply. I insert it without comment.</p>

information touching the Custer affidavit. My impression is, however,
that my informant was Gen. Miles, with whom I communicated
on the subject while I was writing my account. I also conversed personally
with Hughes and with a very intimate friend, now deceased, of
Gen. Terry’s.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>I also wrote to General Miles and received the following reply from
him:</p>

<p class='c022'>In reply to your two letters, you will find in my book, “Personal
Recollections, or from New England to the Golden Gate,” published
by Werner &amp; Co., Akron, Ohio, perhaps all the information you
will require. I can not give the time now to going over the campaign
in detail. I presume you will find the book in most libraries.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c007'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
You will notice in it a chapter on the Custer campaign. General
Custer did not disobey orders. When General Terry divided his command,
taking one portion of it with him up the Yellowstone, and sending
General Custer with the other portion far out in the Indian country,
it necessarily put from seventy-five to one hundred miles between
the two commands, and therefore placed upon General Custer the responsibility
of acting on the offensive or defensive, for he could have
been attacked by the whole body of the combined tribes, and, on the
other hand, if he allowed them to escape without attacking them, he
would have been severely censured. It would be silly to suppose
that Indian chiefs like Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse would permit
two columns to march around over the country with infantry,
cavalry, wagon trains, etc.,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c007'><sup>[117]</sup></a> and wait for them to come up on both
sides simultaneously, and one must believe the American people very
gullible if they thought such a proposition had military merit.</p>

      <div class='line in20'><span class='sc'>Nelson A. Miles</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I immediately wrote General Miles a second letter asking him for
the name of the affiant and any statement he might be willing to make
about the affidavit. I pointed out to him what he very well knew—the
prominence given to the story in his own book indicates that—the
importance of the affidavit in establishing General Custer’s position
and defending him against the charge of disobedience. I received no
answer to this letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the question of the affidavit was taken up by General
Hughes in his several communications to me which appear below.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order not to break the thread of the discourse I will anticipate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>events and here insert a third letter which I wrote to General
Miles, after carefully considering General Hughes’ remarks. The
letter was sent to General Miles by registered mail. I hold the registry

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>A few months since I addressed to you a letter asking you for
the name of the person, alluded to in your book, who made the affidavit
as to the last remark of General Terry to General Custer. This
letter has probably never reached you since I have never received any
answer to it.</p>

<p class='c022'>The statement is questioned by a number of officers, and in the interest
of historical accuracy and for the sake of bringing forward every
particle of evidence tending to clear General Custer of the charges
which are made against him in that campaign, I most respectfully ask
you to give me the name of the affiant together with such other statements
concerning the affidavit as may be conclusive. How did you
become possessed of the affidavit, for instance? Did you see it? Did
you know the affiant? Was he a person whose testimony was to be
implicitly relied upon? Is he alive now? In short, any information
concerning it will be most acceptable as well as most useful.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c025'>

      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Cyrus Townsend Brady</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I do not desire to comment on General Miles’ refusal further than
to say that if he has in his possession the affidavit he should either submit
it to the inspection of impartial observers, give it to historians,
state who made it, where it was made, furnish a certified copy of it to
the public, or otherwise establish it. If he is not willing to do this he
should at least say why he is not willing. I submit that no man, whatever
his rank or station, ought to make statements which affect the
fame and reputation of another man <em>without giving the fullest publicity
to his sources of information, or stating why the public must be content
with a simple reference thereto</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>While I am on the subject of the affidavit, I call the student’s attention
to a possible suggestion in Colonel Godfrey’s second communication
below.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>It is twenty-eight years since the Battle of the Little Big Horn. If
the alleged affiant is now alive, what reason can exist to prevent him
coming out and acknowledging his affidavit? If he is dead, why
should secrecy about it longer exist? Why does not General Miles
break his silence? <em>The whole matter turns on the production of this
affidavit, with satisfactory evidence as to the character of the affiant.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>The other position taken in General Miles’ letter above, which of
course is a summary of his views as set forth in his book, is discussed
later on by General Woodruff.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II.</h4>

<p class='c020'>I now refer the student to the following letter in answer to one from
me asking information and calling General Hughes’ attention to President
Andrews’ book, which has just been reissued in a new and
amplified edition:</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Your letter of the 13th was duly received. I had not heard of
Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews’ book prior to receipt of your letter, but
have looked it up since.</p>

<p class='c022'>After a careful examination of what he says about the Sioux campaign
of 1876, I cannot find any good and sufficient reason for changing
aught that was stated in the article published in the <cite>Journal of the
Military Service Institution</cite>, in January, 1896. I do find, however,
that something could be added to the statement of the case in reply to
new matter which he has injected into it in his book. These items are
three in number, to wit:</p>

<p class='c022'>1st. General Miles does not agree with the views therein expressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>2d. New evidence in the form of an affidavit made by some individual,
name not given.</p>

<p class='c022'>3rd. The writer of the book dissents from my view of the case.</p>

<p class='c022'>We will take these items up severally:</p>

<p class='c022'>First: “General Miles is strongly of the opinion that Custer was not
guilty of disobeying any orders.”</p>

<p class='c022'>It is not a new experience to learn that the views of General Miles
and myself are at variance. Indeed, it seems that they are seldom in
accord. But, in this instance, my views are supported by the late
General P. H. Sheridan, who states as follows:</p>

<p class='c022'>“General Terry, now pretty well informed of the locality of the Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>directed Lieutenant-Colonel George A. Custer to move with the
Seventh Cavalry up the Rosebud, until he struck the trail discovered
by Major Reno, with instructions <em>that he should not follow it directly to
the Little Big Horn, but that he should send scouts over it and keep his
main force farther south</em>.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c007'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>General Gibbon, in a letter to General Terry, written after having
reached his post, Fort Shaw, Montana, and bearing date November
5th, 1876, writes as follows, speaking of the “Conference”:</p>

<p class='c022'>“We both impressed upon him (Custer) that he should keep constantly
feeling to his left, and even should the trail turn toward the
Little Big Horn that he should continue his march southward along
the headwaters of the Tongue, and strike west toward the Little Big
Horn. So strong was the impression upon my mind and great my fear
that Custer’s zeal would carry him forward too rapidly, that the last
thing I said to him when bidding him good-by, after his regiment had
filed past you when starting on the march, was, ‘Now, Custer, don’t
be greedy, but wait for us.’ Poor fellow! Knowing what we do now,
and what an effect a fresh Indian trail seemed to have on him, perhaps
we were expecting too much to anticipate a forbearance on his part
which would have rendered coöperation between the two columns
practicable.”</p>

<p class='c022'>The foregoing clearly shows that no doubt existed in the minds of the
Division Commanders and the third party present at the conference
as to what the instructions required and that those instructions were
not complied with.</p>

<p class='c022'>Second: Dr. Andrews states that there was a listener at the last
conversation between Terry and Custer at the mouth of the Rosebud,
just before Custer began his fatal ride, and that his affidavit sets up
that:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Terry said: ‘Use your own judgment and do what you think
best if you strike the trail and, whatever you do, Custer, hold on to
your wounded.’”</p>

<p class='c022'>It is quite evident that this is the same affidavit which General Miles
refers to in his book. My attention was called to that reference in the
winter of 1896, and in behalf of the family and friends of General
Terry I asked to see the affidavit, saying that I might wish to make
a copy of it. My request was refused by General Miles, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the further information that it had been in his possession for nineteen
years, which carried the date back to a time when Colonel Miles was
commanding a post in General Terry’s Department. The value of
the document could have been very readily determined at that time
by General Terry himself, and I am thankful to say its worthlessness
is still capable of proof.</p>

<p class='c022'>The quotations given by Dr. Andrews would alone be sufficient to
condemn the paper with any one familiar with General Terry and the
situation.</p>

<p class='c022'>It will be noticed that he is represented as saying, “If you strike
the trail.” Terry was sending, with Custer, Reno and six troops of
cavalry, who had followed the trail for many weary miles only three
days before, and there was no “if” in the case.</p>

<p class='c022'>The other quotation is equally incredible. General Terry had an
enviable reputation throughout the army for his exceptional courtesy
on all occasions and under all circumstances, to all those serving in his
command. To have made the remarks quoted, “Whatever you do,
hold on to your wounded,” would have been tantamount to saying
to one of his Lieutenant-Colonels, to whom he was confiding the finest
command in his department, that he considered it necessary to caution
him on the elementary principle of the position assigned him. To
an officer of General Custer’s experience and gallantry such a caution
would have been far from agreeable, and such action would have been
entirely foreign to the life-long conduct of General Terry.</p>

<p class='c022'>But, fortunately, we are not dependent upon deductive evidence in
this instance. There are still living a good many people who were witnesses
of that “march past” and parting of Generals Terry and Custer.
By personal observation I positively know that any one, General
Gibbon excepted, who makes affidavit to the effect that, at the said
parting at the Rosebud, there was a conversation between Terry and
Custer to which he was the only listener, is guilty of perjury.</p>

<p class='c022'>When the notice came that the command was ready to take up its
march I was sitting with Terry and Gibbon. General Terry invited
General Gibbon to go with him and see it. They walked off a few
yards from the bank of the stream and stood together when Custer
joined them. The three remained together until the command had
filed past and the final good-by was said. Custer mounted his horse
and rode off, and Terry and Gibbon came back to where I had remained.
The last remark made to Custer was by Gibbon. If any
change was made at that time in Custer’s orders it was perforce known
to Gibbon, who was alongside of Terry, and the only one who was with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>him and Custer. Now let us see what Gibbon said in a letter written
to General Terry twenty-seven years ago, when he could not foresee
for what purpose his words would be quoted:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Except so far as to draw profit from past experience it is, perhaps,
useless to speculate as to what would have been the result had <em>your
plan</em> been carried out. But I cannot help reflecting that, in that case,
my column, supposing the Indian camp to have remained where it was
when Custer struck it, would have been the first to reach it; that with
our infantry and Gatling guns we should have been able to take care of
ourselves, even though numbering only two-thirds of Custer’s force.”</p>

<p class='c022'>The only person actually in the presence of Terry and Custer at that
final parting, happened to be the third member of the conference, who
knew the “plan,” and on the fifth of the November following he writes
as above, of what would have been the result had “your plan” (Terry’s
conference plan) been carried out.</p>

<p class='c022'>It so happened that I went over this whole subject with General Gibbon
personally only a short time before his death. He certainly knew
nothing of any change in the “conference plan” at that time. Any
historian who makes use of the affidavit General Miles had some years
ago, would do well to look carefully into the facts.</p>

<p class='c022'>Third: Andrews states: “He (Hughes) adduced many interesting
considerations, but seemed to the writer not at all to justify his
views.”</p>

<p class='c022'>I am, by no means, sure that this dissent would have disturbed me if
I had depended on my own judgment alone in submitting the article<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c007'><sup>[119]</sup></a>
for publication, but it so happened that I did not do so. The tragedy
discussed being of an exceedingly grave character, and both the responsible
heads having passed away, rendered it unusually important
that every possible precaution should be taken against mistakes. For
this reason, after the “many interesting considerations” were prepared
for publication, I submitted the article to different <em>competent
military men</em> with the simple question, “Is it conclusive?”</p>

<p class='c022'>The final review was made by General Henry L. Abbott, U. S. Army,
who enjoys a world-wide reputation for military ability and scholarly
attainments. The gentlemen who revised the article were unanimously
of the opinion that the statement was <em>absolutely conclusive</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>and with the support of such men I have felt little anxiety about the
criticisms that have been made.</p>

      <div class='line in22'><span class='sc'>R. P. Hughes</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thereafter I wrote again to General Hughes about some matters
repeated to me in conversation by General Carrington, who told me
that Custer actually got down on his knees to Terry and begged him,
for the sake of Custer’s honor and fame as a soldier, to get the orders
detaining him at Fort Lincoln revoked, so that he might be spared the
disgrace of seeing his regiment march to the front leaving him behind.
Carrington’s recollection was that the scene took place in Terry’s bedroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is General Hughes’ letter on that point:</p>

<p class='c022'>Yours of the 27th at hand. Carrington is all right except as to
location—the incident occurred in General Terry’s office in St. Paul,
corner Fourth and Wabashaw Streets. It drew from Terry a request to
the President to permit Custer to go with him, the answer being through
Sherman, “If Terry wishes Custer let him take him along.” Just
after notifying Custer of the reply and telling him he would take him
along, Custer met Ludlow on the street and made the “swing clear”
remark which is spoken of in Andrews’ history and is referred to in
my article in the journal. I shall have to apply for a copy of the Secretary
of War’s report for 1876, which has the reports of Sheridan,
Crook, Terry, Gibbon, Reno, etc., pages 439–487.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c007'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>III.</h4>

<p class='c020'>Meanwhile I had communicated with Colonel Godfrey, who had
already furnished me with much data in addition to that contained in
his valuable and interesting paper, calling particular attention to some
of the statements made by General Hughes in his article in the <cite>Journal</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span><em>of the Military Service Institution</em>. From Colonel Godfrey I received
the following paper:</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Memoranda for Rev. C. T. Brady</span></p>

<p class='c022'>A semi-official account entitled “Record of Engagements with Hostile
Indians in the Division of the Missouri, from 1868 to 1882,” was
published by the Division of the Missouri. This paper is now being
reprinted in the <cite>United States Cavalry Journal</cite>, Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas. The part relating to the Little Big Horn, is in the October,
1903, number. This account reads:</p>

<p class='c022'>“About two o’clock in the morning of July 25th, the column halted
for about three hours, made coffee, and then resumed the march,
crossed the divide, and by <em>eight o’clock</em> were in the valley of one of the
branches of the Little Big Horn.”</p>

<p class='c022'>This is misleading and not altogether true. We halted about two
<span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, till eight <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, then marched till ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, halted, and it was
not until nearly noon that we crossed the divide. We were in a narrow
valley. The march is correctly described in my article. The
inference is that Custer was so very eager that he crossed the divide
into the valley of the Little Big Horn and put himself where he could
be discovered. General Hughes’ article is a <em>special plea</em> to clear General
Terry from the odium that he and his family seemed to think was
heaped upon him for failure to push forward with the information they
had on June 25th and 26th, and that General Custer’s family and
friends were supposed to hold him (Terry) responsible for the disaster
in a measure. I do not remember a charge of disobedience as having
been made at any time during this campaign; nor, on the other hand,
do I recall that much was said that Terry and Gibbon did not do as
they thought best on June 25th and 26th.</p>

<p class='c022'>The marching distance from the Yellowstone, where Gibbon’s command
was crossed, to the Little Big Horn, was about forty-six miles.
East of the Big Horn, the country over which Gibbon’s forces marched,
was rough—bad lands. The Second Cavalry on its march June 25th,
saw the “big smoke” (from the fire in the bottom at the time of Reno’s
attack) and at once sent word to General Gibbon (and Terry) that they
thought a fight was going on, or something to that effect. I don’t
know when they saw this “big smoke,” but my recollection is that
it corresponded or tallied very well with the time of Reno’s attack.
The Second Cavalry got to the Little Big Horn, four or five miles
above the mouth, about nine-thirty, June 26th. They were then distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>from the battlefield about eight or ten miles—an infantry officer
says six miles. They arrived in the vicinity of our position about
eleven <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, June 27th, nearly two days after the “signs,” the “big
smoke” of the fight, had been communicated.</p>

<p class='c022'>That the country between the Yellowstone and the Little Big Horn
was rough; that the 25th of June was hot; that the water was scarce,
we all know; but we thought it strange that, after they learned from
the Crow scouts—say at ten-thirty, June 26th, on the Little Big Horn—that
a disaster had occurred, it took them so long to get a move.
Yet none of us blamed them for being cautious at that time.</p>

<p class='c022'>General Terry was not an Indian fighter and would never have
made a success of getting Indians on the plains. The idea is preposterous<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c007'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
that a force can march through the open country (a great big
country like we had) pass by the Indians fifty or sixty miles south,
then turn round and find them in the same place, and crush them between
that force and another from the opposite direction. They don’t
linger that way. Our march from eleven <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span>, June 24th, was in a
close country and not exposed—was in a close valley, a branch of
the Rosebud. The Indians who discovered us and sent word to the
village would have discovered our trail and consequently informed
them of our movements.</p>

<p class='c022'>General Custer did not intend to attack until June 26th, the date
Terry was to be at the Little Big Horn.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c007'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Herandeen was the scout
that was to take the information through to Terry, but developments
made it necessary, in General Custer’s opinion, if we were to strike the
Indians at all, that we should do it at once. Even then he expected
only a running fight. Their stand and concentration were unexpected,
because the chance of “surprise” was gone, and he probably
did not send Herandeen, as was intended, to communicate with Terry
for the reason that he did not think he could get through.</p>

<p class='c022'>Now, suppose the Indians had been located on the headwaters of
the Rosebud or Tongue, or Powder, and not on the Little Big Horn,
and we had bumped up behind them on the north, should Custer have
backed away, sent a scout through to Terry, made a detour so as to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>to the south side? Terry’s instructions had fairly located the Indians,
but it was a mere <em>guess</em>.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c007'><sup>[123]</sup></a> On the 17th they had fought Crook to a
retreat, then they concentrated upon the Little Big Horn.</p>

<p class='c022'>In my opinion, if our attack had been delayed even a few hours we
would not have found the Indians all in the village. When we got to
the divide their pony herds were still out grazing; when the attack was
made all herds had been driven into the village; they did not have time
to strike their tepees and steal away. I don’t believe they had a long
warning of our advance. The Indian runners had the same, or a
greater, distance to get back than we had to advance. It was their
evident purpose to drop out of sight of our scouts who were in position
for observation before daylight, and did not see them returning down
the valley on the trail. Therefore, they must have made a wide detour.</p>

<p class='c022'>Again, when they discovered us we were probably in bivouac and,
at all events, an ordinary day’s march distant from the village. The
time of warning, I think, could be safely conjectured as the time of
arrival of the few warriors that came out to meet the advance and attack
Reno. All those warriors that had their ponies handy, I believe,
were assembled at once to come out and meet the troops. The rapid
advance didn’t give the Indians a chance to collect their belongings
and mature any plans to escape; otherwise I believe the expected
“scattering” would have taken place. And in just so much was the
attack a “surprise.”</p>

<p class='c022'>That General Custer deliberately disobeyed Terry’s orders I do not
believe. Custer was intensely in earnest and fully determined to find
the Indians and, when found, to attack them, even if it took him back
to the agencies. Suppose Custer had asked Terry “If I find these Indians
shall I attack, or wait for you?” Undoubtedly Terry would
have replied “Attack!” He was too good a soldier not to appreciate
opportunity, but he was not enough of a cavalryman or Indian fighter
to appreciate the flash-like opportunities for hitting the Indians on the
broad prairies.</p>

<p class='c022'>Custer was what in these modern days is styled a “strenuous” man.
Terry was not. He was the personification of gentleness and deliberateness.
And besides, Terry’s instructions <em>gave the necessary latitude</em>.
He told Custer what he thought should be done but, after all, left it to
Custer’s judgment and discretion when so nearly in contact with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>enemy.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c007'><sup>[124]</sup></a> If Custer had passed on south and the Indians had escaped,
or had gone forth and attacked him, as they had Crook, and defeated
him, would these instructions have shielded him? Not much. He
would have been damned as cordially for the failure of the expedition
as he is now, by those same men, for courting disaster. I have no
doubt in my mind, that if Custer had passed south even one more day,
the Indians would have attacked us as they had General Crook, and
upon almost the same ground, just one week before.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c007'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>Terry says, in his instructions, “He will indicate to you his own
views of what your action should be, and he desires that you should
conform to them unless <em>you should see sufficient reason for departing
from them</em>.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c007'><sup>[126]</sup></a> Custer was an experienced war soldier, a thorough
cavalryman, and an experienced Indian campaigner. So why not give
him the benefit of “sufficient reason”? Were Terry’s instructions
“definite and explicit”? Terry himself says in his order that
“definite instructions” were “impossible.”</p>

<p class='c022'>There was not an officer or soldier of the Seventh Cavalry but that
expected a fight when we were preparing to leave the mouth of the
Rosebud. Where the fight would take place we knew not, but I venture
to say that never was there a thought that the Indians would take
a position and wait there for us to go through a lot of manœuvers.
Reno’s scout had not brought any <em>definite</em> information. I find my
notes (June 20th) say that it was generally thought the trail, when they
left it, was about <em>three weeks old</em> and the indications showed perhaps
three hundred and fifty lodges. I don’t think General Terry had any
later information than Reno’s scout on which to guess the location of
the Indians on the Little Big Horn. General Custer’s statement that
he would follow the trail until he found the Indians, even if it took us
to the agencies on the Missouri or in Nebraska, does not indicate that
he expected them to wait in position on the Little Big Horn or elsewhere.
This statement was made after it had been decided that we
should go over the trail, June 21st, but probably before the general
instructions had been made out.</p>

<p class='c022'>As it turned out I think Custer did make a mistake in going in with
a divided force, not that the division of itself would have been fatal,
but because Reno failed to hold a leg even if he couldn’t skin.</p>

<p class='c022'>If Custer had followed Reno the latter, in my opinion, would never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>have dared to halt, or even hesitate, in his attack. If Reno had even
held to the bottom, the overwhelming forces would have been divided.
There was nothing in Reno’s past career that would indicate confidence
should not be placed in his courage. Custer could not have
anticipated a faint-hearted attack or that Reno would get stampeded.</p>

<p class='c022'>I believe that Reno was dismayed when he saw the showing in front
of him, and when he failed to see the “support” promised, I think he
lost his nerve, and then when his Ree scouts stampeded and he found
his force being surrounded in the bottom, I believe he abandoned himself
to his fears, then stampeded to the hills and lost his reason, throwing
away his ivory handled pistols. If Reno had held to the bottom,
Custer’s left flank (Keogh and Calhoun) would not have been so quickly
overwhelmed (for the Indians leaving Reno made that envelopment),
and it is reasonable to suppose Custer would have had a better
show to withdraw and rejoin other forces.</p>

<p class='c022'>If Custer had followed up Reno he would have taken matters in
his own hands, held and concentrated his men in such manner as
to control the situation until Benteen and the packs came up. The
Indians, as a rule, will not stand punishment unless cornered. I
went over the ground in the bottom where Reno was when he concluded
to go to the hills, and I believe he could have held the position.
I talked the matter over with General Gibbon and he practically
agreed with me. I know many others think otherwise, including
some who were in that part of the fight.</p>

<p class='c022'>I have doubts about the saving of Custer if Reno had advanced after
the packs joined us, for I think the fight was practically over then.
To have advanced before then might possibly have done something in
favor of Custer, but probably not. I am of the opinion that part of
the fight was settled quickly. Custer’s battalion had practically no
shelter and no time to make any. While a good many horses were
killed, I fear that most of those getting away carried their reserve ammunition,
and it didn’t take long to get away with fifty rounds in a
fight. With a different commander than Reno we might have created
a diversion by advancing as soon as the ammunition packs came up,
which was some little time before McDougall arrived with all the packs.
Reno was apparently too busy waiting for further orders from Custer
to take any initiative. Weir asked permission to take his troop to reconnoiter
in the direction of the firing on Custer, and Reno would not
give it. Weir started on his own hook, and Edgerly (Weir’s Lieutenant)
supposing permission had been given for the troop, followed
Weir with the troop. I think Reno subsequently tried to make it appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>that this advance of Weir was by authority. I don’t think Reno
was drunk, for I don’t believe there was enough whiskey in the command
to make a “drunk.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c007'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>At the Reno Court of Inquiry I was asked if I thought Reno had
done all he could as a commanding officer, and I replied “No.” That
was about the effect of the question and answer. The testimony and
proceedings were reported in full in the Chicago <cite>Times</cite>. The New
York <cite>Herald</cite> had an able correspondent, Mr. Kelly, that joined our
forces on the Yellowstone in July or August, and wrote, giving all the
information he could gather from all sources that pervaded the command,
that he could <em>get at</em>. There were a “whole lot” of correspondents
in the field after the fight, but Mr. Kelly was considered one of
the ablest. Being in the field till September 26th, we saw but few
newspapers from the east.</p>

<p class='c020'>The statement of General Sheridan, quoted by Hughes, was
made in his annual report for 1876, and of course from data
furnished by General Terry. It is but natural that he should
reflect more or less the views of Terry. He could have had only
the newspaper and other unofficial accounts. Of course I recognize
that “unofficial accounts” very often give more <em>inside</em> information
than the official report.</p>

<p class='c000'>A word as to that affidavit. I don’t know anything about it and am
ready to take Hughes’ say-so as to what <em>officers</em> were present, but I
suggest a possible solution: When Custer dismounted he had his orderly
and generally his flags with him; naturally the orderly would be
somewhat retired, and when Custer went to mount his horse, Terry
may have gone aside to accompany him and spoken the caution to him
in a subdued voice so that Gibbon would not have heard him, but the
orderly might have heard.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c007'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In going over a lot of letters relating to the campaign, etc., I find one
from General J. S. Brisbin (now dead), then Major, commanding
Second Cavalry Battalion. It is dated January 1st, 1892, just two
weeks before his death. In it he is very bitter against Custer. He
says that Custer disobeyed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If not in letter, then in spirit, and I think and have ever thought, in
letter as well as spirit. Terry intended, if he intended anything, that
we should be in the battle with you. I was on the boat, steamer Far
West, Captain Grant Marsh, the night of the 21st, when the conference
took place between Gibbon, Custer and Terry, to which you refer,
and I heard what passed. Terry had a map and Custer’s line of
march up the Rosebud was blocked out on it by pins stuck in the table
through the paper. Terry showed Custer his line of march and, being
somewhat near-sighted as you know, Terry asked me to mark the line,
and I did so with a blue pencil. Custer turned off that line of march
from the Rosebud, just twenty miles <em>short</em> of the end of the pins and
blue line.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just how much dependence can be placed on Brisbin’s statements I
don’t know. He may have been present at this conference, but Hughes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>makes no mention of him; in fact, entirely ignores him and may have
forgotten him. I will make another quotation from Brisbin:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I read the order you print as being the one given by Terry to Custer
for this march. If that is the order Custer got it is not the order
copied in Terry’s books at Department Headquarters. You will remember
that after Custer fell Terry appointed me chief of cavalry. I
looked over all the papers affecting the march and battle of Little Big
Horn and took a copy of the order sending you up the Rosebud. The
order now lies before me and it says ‘you should proceed up the Rosebud
until you ascertain definitely the direction in which the trail above
spoken of leads (Terry had already referred to the trail Reno followed).
Should it be found, as it appears almost certain that it should be found,
to turn toward the Little Big Horn, he thinks (that is, the Department
Commander thinks) that you should still proceed southward, perhaps
as far as the headwaters of the Tongue River, and <em>then</em> (‘then’ underscored
in order) turn <em>toward Little</em> Big Horn, feeling constantly, however,
to your left, so as to preclude the possibility of the escape of the
Indians to the south or southeast by passing around your left flank.
It is desired that you conform as nearly as possible to those instructions
and that you do not depart from them unless you shall see
absolute necessity for doing so.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>That part of the quotation from “It is desired” to “necessity for
doing so,” is omitted in the order as printed in the report of General
Terry. Not having seen the original order I cannot vouch for either
being the true copy, but the omission looks peculiar to say the least,
if omission there was.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c007'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I do not know that I can add very much to what I have already sent
to you on the question of disobedience. Here is a commander who has
had experience in war, civilized and Indian, sent in command of his
regiment against an unnumbered foe, located we know not where
(although well conjectured in the instructions, as it turned out); given
instructions to <em>preclude their</em> escape; to coöperate with another column
separated from fifty to one hundred miles, having infantry and artillery,
marching over a rough, untried country. Now if that commander
thought that to go on farther south before he had located the foe
(when he was on the trail) was to leave an opening and an almost certainty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of their escape, if they wanted to do so, is it reasonable to expect
him to leave the trail and go on “in the air”? The commander who
gives him his instructions cannot be communicated with. Is this isolated
commander not allowed to act on his own responsibility, if he
thinks he cannot <em>preclude</em> the escape by leaving the very trail that will
locate the enemy?</p>

<p class='c000'>Hughes in his article, and the official reports, make it appear that
we were at or near the “Crow’s Nest” at daylight and crossed the
divide at eight <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> The scouts were at the “Crow’s Nest,” but at
eight <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we took up the march to near the divide and “Crow’s
Nest,” arriving at ten o’clock, <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>; that is, we were in the Rosebud
Valley, one mile from the divide. We did not cross the divide till
nearly noon. Hughes seems to pooh-pooh the idea that we were not
to attack till the morning of the 26th. We had Custer’s own statement
as to that. He said so himself when he called the officers together
on the night of June 24th and again reiterated the statement before
crossing the divide.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the second or third day (23rd or 24th) up the Rosebud, several
times we thought we (I mean some of us) saw smoke in the direction
of the Tullock, and finally we spoke of it to the General (Custer)
at one of the halts. He said it could not be, that he had scouts over
on that side and they most certainly would have seen any such “signs”
and report to him, and he reiterated that there were scouts out looking
toward Tullock’s Valley. After this assurance we made it a point
to watch this “smoke business” and we discovered the illusion was
due to fleecy clouds on the horizon and the mirage, or heated air, rising
from the hills on that side. The air was full of dust from our
marching columns, which helped the illusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>With reference to my slip that “about eighteen hundred had gone
<em>from one agency</em> alone.” I took that from my diary, as I had been informed
by some one who got the information from Department Headquarters.
I had never seen the despatch and put down the item as it
came to me. It was a matter of common report in the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another point occurs to me: “For Custer to be in coöperating
distance on the only line of retreat if the Indians should run away.”
(Hughes’ magazine article, page 36.) Hughes intimates that there
was only one line of retreat, presumably up the valley of the Little Big
Horn. The Indians certainly could have retreated over their traveled
route, or could have cut across the headwaters of the Tullock for
the Yellowstone had Custer gone south. Hughes seems to forget that
an almost impassably rough country—the Wolf Mountains—would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>lie between Custer and those lines of retreat. Yet he would insist
that it was good generalship to leave these routes open to close up
one other. The Indians were in light marching order and could travel
faster than Gibbon over the Tullock Divide, and there would have
been a long-distance, “tail-end” pursuit for Custer when he descended
the Little Big Horn (by following the “plan”) and found the enemy
had escaped over the very trail he had left behind him, or had struck
for the Yellowstone, passing Gibbon’s left.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been the criticism almost ever since Indian fighting began that
commanders were too prone to follow some strategic theory and fail to
bring the Indians to battle—give them a chance to escape. It was
Custer’s practice to take the trail and follow it, locate the enemy and
then strike home by a surprise attack. Custer knew the ridicule and
contempt heaped on commanders who had failed to strike when near
the enemy; or who had given the enemy opportunity to escape when
nearly in contact with them. Whatever may be the academic discussions
as to his disobedience, I hold that he was justified by sound
military judgment in making his line of march on the trail.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c007'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c019'>IV.</h4>

<p class='c020'>General Hughes and Colonel Godfrey may be considered fairly
enough as representatives of the opposing views on the question. I
thought it would be well to have the papers discussed by an officer who
might be considered as taking an impartial view of the matter. I
therefore sent them to Brigadier-General Charles A. Woodruff, U. S. A.
(retired), and his review of the whole question is as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>103 Market Street,</div>

</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My Dear Dr. Brady:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I have read with a great deal of pleasure, your three articles on
“War with the Sioux,” and I have taken the liberty of making various
marginal notes and corrections on the manuscript. I have also read
the letters from General Miles, Professor Andrews, General Hughes,
and Colonel Godfrey.</p>

<p class='c022'>General Miles, in his letter of November 20, 1903, dismisses the
matter very curtly. He says “Custer did not disobey orders,” and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>states as military dictum that, in sending General Custer seventy-five
or one hundred miles away, Terry could not indicate what Custer
should do, and that, practically, Custer was not under any obligations
to execute Terry’s orders, even when he found conditions as Terry had
expected and indicated.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c007'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>The order states explicitly “Should it—the trail up the Rosebud—be
found (as it appears almost certain it will be found) to turn toward
the Little Big Horn, then you should still proceed southward.” Now,
when he found that it turned toward the Little Big Horn, instead of
going south or stopping where he was and scouting south or southwest
and west and try to locate the village, or examining Tullock Creek, or
sending scouts to Gibbon, he made that fatal night march with the
deliberate intention of trying to locate and strike the village before
Gibbon could possibly get up.</p>

<p class='c022'>Gibbon says (page 473, Vol. I., Report of the Secretary of War for
1876), “The Department Commander (Terry) strongly impressed
upon him (Custer) the propriety of not pressing his march too rapidly.”
Whether Custer’s written instructions were based upon a “guess” of
the actual condition, as Colonel Godfrey suggests, or had no “military
merit,” as General Miles states, the facts remain: First: That they
were based upon a “foresight” as good as the present “hindsight,”
which is often not the case. Second: That Custer accepted them without
demur. Third: No further information was gained to suggest a
modification, or, to use the words of the letter: “unless you see sufficient
reason for departing from them.” On the contrary, the supposed
turn of the trail was found to be an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c022'>Therefore, Custer did not obey his written instructions, in letter or
spirit, and had no proper military justification for not doing so, unless
General Terry afterwards told him, “Use your own judgment and
do what you think best,” which, in my opinion, would have made the
instructions advisory rather than positive orders. If these facts (I ignore
the unproduced affidavit) do not constitute disobedience of orders,
I do not see how it is possible for the charge of disobedience of orders
to hold against any man, under any circumstances, when away from
his superior.</p>

<p class='c022'>Here is a trifling sidelight on the matter. On the night of June 23d,
General Gibbon, in reply to an optimistic remark of mine, told me in
effect, “I am satisfied that if Custer can prevent it we will not get into
the fight.” The meaning I gathered was that Gibbon thought that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Custer was so eager to retrieve the good opinion that he might have
lost owing to his controversy over post traderships, that he would
strike when and where he could.</p>

<p class='c022'>While Terry, with Gibbon’s command, was camped at Tullock’s
Creek, Saturday night and Sunday morning, June 24th and 25th, he
was looking for a message from Custer very anxiously, so I was told
at the time.</p>

<p class='c022'>Colonel Godfrey speaks of the odium Terry’s family seemed to
think was “heaped upon him for the failure to push forward on the
information they had on June 25th and 26th.” Now let me say a few
words with reference to that.</p>

<p class='c022'>The smoke that is spoken of as having been seen by Terry’s command—and
I saw it myself—was on the afternoon of June 25th. It
was occasioned, I understood, by attempts to drive some of Reno’s
stragglers out of the brush, and must have been somewhere from two to
four o’clock in the afternoon. Now let me quote from a telegram of
General Terry, dated June 27, and found on page 463, Vol. I., Report
of the Secretary of War of 1876, to show that Gibbon’s command did
not linger by the wayside:</p>

<p class='c022'>“Starting soon after five o’clock in the morning of the 25th, the infantry
made a march of twenty-two miles over the most difficult country
which I have ever seen. In order that the scouts might be sent into
the valley of the Little Big Horn, the cavalry, with the battery, was
then pushed on thirteen or fourteen miles farther, reaching camp at
midnight. The scouts were sent out at half-past four in the morning
of the 26th. They soon discovered three Indians, who were at first
supposed to be Sioux; but, when overtaken, they proved to be Crows,
who had been with General Custer. They brought the first intelligence
of the battle. Their story was not credited. It was supposed
that some fighting, perhaps severe fighting, had taken place; but it was
not believed that disaster could have overtaken so large a force as
twelve companies of cavalry. The infantry, which had broken camp
very early, soon came up, and the whole column entered and moved up
the valley of the Little Big Horn.”</p>

<p class='c022'>I want to say that the infantry broke camp about four o’clock on the
morning of the 26th. It had rained that preceding night and the lash
ropes of the packs were soaked with water and, as we moved, they
stretched continuously and we were stopping constantly to replace the
packs, and besides that, mind you, traveling in adobe mud was very
trying. I continue the quotation as follows:</p>

<p class='c022'>“During the afternoon efforts were made to send scouts through to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>what was supposed to be General Custer’s position, to obtain information
of the condition of affairs; but those who were sent out were
driven back by parties of Indians, who, in increasing numbers, were
seen hovering in General Gibbon’s front. At twenty minutes before
nine o’clock in the evening, the infantry had marched between twenty-nine
and thirty miles. The men were very weary and daylight was
fading. The column was therefore halted for the night, at a point
about eleven miles in a straight line from the mouth of the stream.
This morning the movement was resumed, and, after a march of nine
miles, Major Reno’s intrenched position was reached.”</p>

<p class='c022'>It was the general opinion from indications found next day just beyond
where we halted for the night, that had we proceeded five hundred
yards more, we would have been in the midst of a night attack
from the Sioux Indians, who came to meet us as a means of guarding
their fleeing village.</p>

<p class='c022'>In reference to the number of Indians, the same telegram of General
Terry’s says: “Major Reno and Captain Benteen, both of whom are
officers of great experience, accustomed to seeing large masses of
mounted men, estimate the number of Indians engaged at not less
than twenty-four hundred. Other officers think that the number was
greater than this. The village in the valley was about three miles in
length and about a mile in width. Besides the lodges proper, a great
number of temporary brushwood shelters were found in it, indicating
that many men, besides its proper inhabitants, had gathered together
there.”</p>

<p class='c022'>I am under the impression now that we counted positions occupied
by twelve hundred lodges.</p>

<p class='c022'>I coincide with your view that had Reno proceeded in his attack, with
the audacity that should characterize, and usually does characterize, a
cavalry charge, there would have been a different story to tell; perhaps
as many men would have been killed, but they would have been divided
among at least eight, if not eleven, troops of cavalry rather than
concentrated in five, which meant annihilation for those.</p>

<p class='c022'>I have been told, or was told at the time, that it was thought that
about sixty lodges were a few miles up the Little Big Horn above the
main village, and that, in the early morning, when Custer’s proximity
was discovered, that this small village, knowing that they were but a
mouthful for Custer’s command, hurriedly packed up and dashed down
the valley. It can readily be understood that sixty lodges, with the
horses and paraphernalia, moving rapidly down the valley, might well
create the impression that a very large force was in retreat.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Now, if the Indian village was in retreat, Custer’s division of his
forces was not altogether bad. One command to hurry them up and
continue the stampede, his main force to attack them in the right flank
if they turned that way, which was most probable, Benteen’s to attack
them if they turned to the left, which was possible but not as probable.</p>

<p class='c022'>Unfortunately for Custer they were not fleeing. Colonel Godfrey
rather dwells upon the fact that Custer had to attack these Indians or
they would have gotten away from him. The fact is, as I have stated
above, when he left the Rosebud he did not know where they were,
had not located them, was not in visual contact even with them, and
a glance at the map will show that, standing on the Rosebud, where the
trail left it to go over to the Little Big Horn, Custer was in the best
possible position for intercepting these Indians on three of their four
lines of retreat. For having passed into the Little Big Horn Valley,
there were only four practicable routes of flight for the Indians, north,
toward Gibbon, or east, northeast, or southeast. From the point
where he left the Rosebud, Custer was in a position to strike either one
of the three last lines of flight, whereas, if, after making the forced
night march with his fatigued animals, he had struck the Little Big
Horn, and a reconnaissance had shown that the village had left the Little
Big Horn, going northeast, on the 24th of June, he would have been
two days’ march behind them.</p>

<p class='c022'>Had he sent a scout, on the night of the 24th, to Gibbon, whose
exact whereabouts was almost known to him, that scout would have
reached Terry or Gibbon, on Tullock’s Fork, a few miles from the
Yellowstone, on the morning of Sunday, and by Sunday night Gibbon’s
command would have been within less than ten miles of what is designated
as Custer Peak, the hill on which Custer perished. Then, with
Custer moving on the morning of the 26th, Gibbon’s infantry and
Gatling guns could have forced those Sioux out of the village on to the
open ground, extending from the Little Big Horn to the Big Horn, and
Custer’s twelve troops of cavalry and Gibbon’s four, sixteen troops in
all, between them would have made the biggest killing of Indians who
needed killing ever made on the American continent since Cortez invaded
Mexico. While this is a speculation, and an idle one, it is to my
mind a rather interesting one.</p>

<p class='c022'>I think myself that General Hughes makes out his case in reference
to that affidavit that General Miles has so carefully treasured for so
many years. It would be a very interesting historical document, but it
would have been more satisfactory if it had been produced while Terry
or General Gibbon or both were alive. I doubt very much whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Major Brisbin’s supposed copy of the order book at Terry’s headquarters
was compared with the original after Brisbin had
made it.</p>

<p class='c022'>I regret to say that my paper upon this campaign was lost, and I have
not even the notes from which it was written. I found one brief page,
which I quote merely as indication of my reasons for believing that
there were more than two thousand Indian warriors in the battle of
June 25th: “Before May 10th of ’77 more than one thousand warriors
came in and surrendered, not including the warriors killed in that
battle or the half dozen other engagements, nor the individual warriors
by the hundreds that sneaked back to the agencies and those who
went to British America under Sitting Bull, numbering, it was understood,
over two thousand warriors.”</p>

<p class='c022'>I do not think you are too severe upon Major Reno. I conversed
with most of the officers of that command at one time or another,
while in the field, and nearly all were very pronounced in their severe
criticism of Reno. The testimony at the Reno court of inquiry was less
severe than the sentiments expressed within a few days, weeks, and
months after the occurrence. That was perhaps natural. It is barely
possible that some of it was due to the fact that Captain Weir, one
of General Custer’s most pronounced friends and one of Major Reno’s
most bitter critics, died before the court of inquiry met.</p>

<p class='c022'>I do not think that Sturgis, Porter, etc., were captured and tortured.
I found most of the lining of Porter’s coat in the camp, which showed
that the bullet that struck him must have broken the back and passed
in or out at the navel. My theory has been, with reference to those
whose bodies could not be found, that most of them made a dash into
the Bad Lands in the direction of the mouth of the Rosebud, where
they had last seen General Gibbon’s command. It would have been
easy for them to have perished from thirst in the condition they were
in, and if they reached the Yellowstone and undertook to swim it, the
chances were decidedly against their succeeding.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Dr. Brady:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I appreciate the favor of reading the proof-sheets of the appendix
to your papers upon the Custer massacre. When it occurred I was
greatly shocked by an event so similar in its horrors to that of the Phil
Kearney massacre, in 1866. A previous interview with General Custer
came to mind, and I attended the sessions of the court of inquiry
at Chicago, taking with me, for reference, a map which I had carefully
prepared of that country, with the assistance of James Bridger, my
chief guide, and his associates.</p>

<p class='c022'>The evidence indicated that when Custer reached the “Little Big
Horn” (so known upon that map) and sent Benteen up stream, with
orders that, “if he saw any Indians, to give them hell,” ordering Reno
to follow the trail across the river and move down toward the Indian
camps, while he moved down the right bank, detaching himself from
the other commands, he practically cut the Indians off from retreat to
the mountains, which was part of his special mission; but, in the flush
of immediate battle, lost thought of the combined movement from
the Big Horn, which had for its purpose the destruction of the entire
Indian force by overwhelming and concentrated numbers.</p>

<p class='c022'>Indeed, the court of inquiry did not so much discredit the conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>of Reno as reveal the fact that he faced a vastly superior force with no
assurance that he could have immediate support from the other battalions,
so vital in a sudden collision with desperate and hard-pressed
enemies. The succeeding fight, on the defensive, protracted as it was,
with no information of Custer’s position, or possible support from him,
was a grave commentary upon the whole affair.</p>

<p class='c022'>The interview with General Custer referred to was in 1876, when,
upon leaving the lecture platform of the Historical Society in New York,
he made the remark, on our way to his hotel, “It will take another
Phil Kearney massacre to bring Congress up to a generous support of
the army.” We spent several hours together, while he discussed his
troubles with the authorities at Washington. He recalled the events of
1867, and felt that General Sherman had severely judged his operations
on the Republican, but that the time was near when he might have an
opportunity to vindicate himself, and that, “if he again had a chance
he would accomplish it or die in the attempt.” He was practically on a
leave of absence, and its extension was not his choice. Colonel Smith
was sick, and he claimed the right to command his regiment, since it
had been ordered to report as part of General Terry’s command.</p>

<p class='c022'>The famous sutlership scandal was fully discussed, and here there
has been confusion as to Custer’s position. He had nothing to do with
the popular complaint that Belknap was farming out sutlerships for
personal emolument. Neither is it technically correct that the Secretary
of War could make original appointments of the kind complained
of. Post commanders, with their councils of officers, had both the
selection of their sutler, and fixed the prices of articles to be sold.
The Secretary simply issued the appointment thus designated, unless
for good reasons declined, thereby requiring another selection by the
officers. In cases of troops in campaign, or detached, or on distant service,
the commanding General confirmed the officer’s choice. Custer’s
position was manly, legal, and just; but his assertion of this right,
so far as made, offended Belknap, at the expense of officers whose
rights were overruled by non-military influence.</p>

<p class='c022'>Custer was <em>not under charges</em> that would militate against his assignment
to the rightful command of his regiment when ordered into field
service. I did not hesitate to urge him to press his claim, but could
not entertain the idea that he would go to Bismarck, or otherwise to
make his claim in person, except through Washington Headquarters.</p>

<p class='c022'>If ever a man had an incentive to dare odds with his regiment, this
fearless fighter and rider, whose spirit reached the verge of frenzy in
battle, was the man for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>Through all the papers cited by you, there runs the same subtle
suggestion that he who, as an independent commander of aggressive
cavalry in the Civil War, was almost expected to take into the field a
large discretion as to his actions (whereby he had formerly achieved
success) when confronted by the enemy, within striking distance in the
Little Big Horn Valley, lost all sense of danger and all thought of
prescribed details of action in the confidence that, somehow, the old
Seventh could not be whipped by any savage force whatsoever!</p>

<p class='c022'>I have always regarded Terry’s general plan as well conceived, for
Reno’s prior scouting had almost assured the inevitable course of the
Indian trail westward, and events confirmed Terry’s judgment.
General Hughes had served upon Terry’s staff during the Civil War
with credit, as well as captain in the 18th Infantry on the frontier,
and his assurances that General Terry fully explained to Custer
the reasons why Washington authorities distrusted his discretion and
was more precise in giving him this detached command, cannot be impeached
by an asserted affidavit that whispered hints, unheard by
officers by his side, allowed him to be his own master in a matter where
a combined movement of three commands was the prime factor in
complete success.</p>

<p class='c022'>Neither is there any doubt whatever that Custer’s earnest plea, that
he be trusted to fulfil the exact duties assigned to his command,
secured not only the sympathy and confidence of Terry in his behalf,
but that on that condition only did the Washington authorities authorize
General Terry to vacate the order for his arrest because of going
to his command without orders.</p>

<p class='c022'>As already stated, Custer’s confidence in the Seventh Cavalry was
well deserved. It, with him, was a veritable thunderbolt in action;
but it was not omnipotent. That over-confidence which dissolved its
unity at the supreme crisis was fatal. Even then, a realized success
of which Custer had no doubt, would have minimized the rashness of
his dash and have largely condoned his fault.</p>

<h5 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Colonel Godfrey’s Final Remarks</span></h5>

<p class='c020'>I have no desire to pose as the special champion of General Custer,
and it is still further from my desire to pose as inimical to General
Terry. My only purpose is to demonstrate the truth, not only for this
discussion, but for history.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>This subject surely has gotten to the stage of academic discussion.
I am not willing to admit that the phrase “he desires that you should
conform to them (his views) unless,” etc., conveys a direct, positive
command which could not be more explicit. Nor do I admit that
orders given by a commander, in which he uses the words “desires,”
“wishes,” and equivalents, convey <em>positive</em> commands under all circumstances.
In personal or social matters, such words convey the idea
of what is wanted and what is expected; and in such matters the
expressed wishes and desires are usually conveyed to personal friends,
who loyally conform thereto, if not in letter, in spirit and in results.
In such relations a commander does not want to use language that
would appear dogmatic. I further admit that in personally giving
orders a commander may accentuate the expression of his desires,
wishes, etc., so as to leave no doubt about his intentions, and to convey
positiveness thus expressed to his commands. When a commander
gives written orders through official channels, the words “commands,”
“orders,” and “directs,” or the use of the imperative, leave little ambiguity
or doubt as to what is ordered or intended.</p>

<p class='c000'>Developments subsequent to the campaign or battle leave little
doubt that General Terry had about him men or influences that were
suspicious, inimical, or hostile to General Custer. I sincerely believe
General Terry was too high minded knowingly to allow himself to
be influenced by any sinister motive.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the “instructions” give rise to this discussion shows they were
vague. Was this vagueness intentional? General Terry was a lawyer.
He was a soldier. As lawyer and soldier his trained mind
should have weighed the words embodied in these instructions. Now
read them: “It is of course <em>impossible</em><a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c007'><sup>[132]</sup></a> to give you any <em>definite instructions</em>
in regard to this movement, and were it not <em>impossible</em> to
do so, the Department Commander places too much confidence in your
zeal, energy, and ability <em>to wish to impose upon you precise orders</em> which
might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy,”
and then goes on to indicate what he thinks should be done; or, in other
words, indicates what he (Terry) himself would do if he found conditions
as expressed. Custer evidently saw “sufficient reasons for departing
from them” and did what a reasonable interpretation of the
instructions contemplated, <em>made his own plans</em>.<a href='#f132' class='c007'><sup>[132]</sup></a> I interpret the phrase
“when so nearly in contact with the enemy” to refer to the immediate
time or place (June 21, mouth of Rosebud) of writing it.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c007'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>As to the location of the Indians. Terry believed they were on the
Little Big Horn;—we found them on that river about 15 miles above
its forks with the Big Horn. Had the village been at the forks, the
attack would have been delivered on the 25th of June, as the village
would not have been located by Custer from the divide. It is possible
the two columns might have joined in the attack. Now, suppose the
village had been located 50 or 60 miles farther south, it would have
still been within Terry’s guess, but it would have been a far cry to Gibbons’
column which, under the instructions, would have remained at
the forks. It must be remembered that Custer would have had the
Wolf Mountains (Rosebud Mountains on later maps) between him
and the Little Big Horn had he ignored the trail and gone on
southward up the Rosebud, as Custer’s critics would have us believe
were the intentions of the instructions.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Woodruff would have him stop at the camp of June 24
and scout to locate the village, etc. Would that have complied with
Woodruff’s interpretation of the instructions? And from that position
he says: “Custer was in a position to strike either one of the three
last lines of flight (east, northeast or southeast), whereas if, after making
the <em>forced</em><a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c007'><sup>[134]</sup></a> night march with his fatigued animals, he had struck
the Little Big Horn, and a reconnaissance had shown that the village
had left the Little Big Horn going northeast, on June 24 he would
have been two days’ march behind them.” That “forced” night march
was about eight miles, and every mile made was in the direction to
place us in the best position to intercept any flight to the northeast and
east. Instead of being two days behind them, we would have met
them almost “head on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of what practical use to send scouts through to Gibbon June 24?</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no fresh or new positive information to send to him;
Terry had “guessed” it all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now let us repeat the marches made: June 22, twelve miles;
June 23, thirty-three miles; June 24, twenty-eight miles; June 25,
eight miles to the bivouac; and ten miles to the divide, and then say
fifteen miles to the village. That is to say, ninety-one miles up to noon
June 25, when it was decided to attack, and one hundred and six miles
in all four days. That doesn’t indicate that we made <em>forced</em> marches.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Woodruff further states that “he made that fatal night march with
the <em>deliberate</em>(?) intention of trying to locate and strike the village before
Gibbon could possibly get up.” I say that statement is deliberately
unfair, and contradicts the twice-told statement by Custer, that he did
not intend to attack the village until the 26th, once before he knew the
location of the village, the night of the 24th, and again when he called
the officers together after the discovery at the divide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reno’s position in the bottom, in the old river bed, was sheltered
from fire from the hills by heavy timber, and was nearly a mile from
the hills. I have never before heard that he was fired upon from those
hills; but he was fired upon from the woods on the opposite side of the
river. General Gibbon and I both thought the hills were too far away
to give any effective fire. It must be remembered that the river bottom
was heavily timbered for some distance above and below this
position. This timber subsequently was cut for the construction of
Fort Custer.</p>

      <div class='line'>My Dear Sir:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I have read with great interest your discussion of the question of
General Custer’s alleged disobedience of orders, both in the narrative
of the Battle on the Little Big Horn and in the appendix to the volume,
and upon which you have asked my comment.</p>

<p class='c022'>For whatever bearing it may have upon the propriety of any comment
of mine, let me say that General Custer was my intimate friend,
and that his first act after receiving his appointment in the Civil War
as a brigadier-general was to secure my appointment and detail to him
as adjutant-general, which relation I held until his muster out of the
volunteer service in 1866. I think no one knows better his quality as
a soldier and as a man. I know his virtues and his defects, which were
the defects of his virtues. He was a born soldier, and specifically a
born cavalry man. The true end of warfare was to him not only a
professional theory—it was an instinct. When he was set to destroy an
enemy, he laid his hand on him as soon as possible, and never took it
off. He knew the whole art of war. But its arts and its instruments
and their correct professional handling were not in his eyes the end all of
a soldier’s career, to be satisfied with a technical performance. They
were the means and the tools in the terms of which and by the use of
which his distinct military genius apprehended and solved its practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>and fateful problems. When he grappled his task it was to do it, not
to go correctly through the proper motions to their technical limit, and
then hold himself excused.</p>

<p class='c022'>He was remarkable for his keenness and accuracy in observation,
for his swift divination of the military significance of every element of
a situation, for his ability to make an instant and sound decision, and
then, for the instant, exhaustless energy with which he everlastingly
drove home his attack. And the swiftness and relentless power of his
stroke were great elements in the correctness of his decisions as well as
in the success of his operations. He was wise and safe in undertaking
that in which a man slower in observation, insight and decision, and
slower and less insistent in action, would have judged wrongly and
failed.</p>

<p class='c022'>I knew Custer as a soldier when he was a brigade and division commander
under Pleasanton and Sheridan, the successive commanders
of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Those who knew the
estimate in which those great commanders held him—the tasks they
committed to his soldierly intelligence and comprehension, his fidelity
and skill—need no reminder that in nothing of all their dependence
upon and confidence in him did he ever fail in letter or spirit. I know
how absolutely loyal he was under the conflicting conditions which
sometimes confront every subordinate charged with grave responsibilities,
and which test the sense of duty to the utmost. He was true
as steel. He was depended upon for great things because he was
dependable.</p>

<p class='c022'>In temperament he was sanguine and ardent. He loved his friends;
he was impatient of every form of inefficiency and of pretense; he did
not highly esteem mere professionalism; he was impulsive and sometimes
abrupt in manner, but kind of heart; he was sensitive only to
unjust criticism; he despised intrigue, chicane and all meanness; he
was independent in opinion and judgment, and frank in their expression;
he was open in opposition, and fair to an enemy.</p>

<p class='c022'>And it goes without saying that such a man had enemies—men who
were envious of his abilities, his achievements and his fame; men whom
he never sought to placate, and who sought envy’s balm in detraction
and hatred; men who could not measure him or be fair to him, but
men who in a pinch would have turned to him with unhesitating trust,
whether in his ability or his soldierly faith.</p>

<p class='c022'>Did this man, this soldier, whose service throughout the Civil War
and a long career of frontier warfare was for eighteen years unequaled
for efficiency and brilliancy within the range of its opportunities and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>responsibilities, who never failed his commanders, who never disobeyed
an order, nor disappointed an expectation, nor deceived a friend—did
this man, at the last, deny his whole life history, his whole mental and
moral habit, his whole character, and wilfully disobey an understood
order, or fail of its right execution according to his best judgment,
within the limits of his ability under the conditions of the event; and,
what is worse—and this is what his detractors charge—did he not
only disobey, but did he from the inception of the enterprise plan
to disobey—to deceive his commander who trusted him, in order that
he might get the opportunity to disobey?</p>

<p class='c022'>To any man who knew Custer, except those who for any reason hold
a brief against him, not only is the charge of premeditated, deliberate
disobedience absurd, but it is a foul outrage on one of the memories
that will never fail of inspiration while an American army carries and
defends an American flag.</p>

<p class='c022'>In one of Mrs. Custer’s letters to me, narrating what took place
during the days of preparation for the General’s departure, she wrote:</p>

<p class='c022'>“A day before the expedition started, General Terry was in our
house alone with Autie (the General’s pet name). A.’s thoughts were
calm, deliberate, and solemn. He had been terribly hurt in Washington.
General Terry had applied for him to command the expedition.
He was returned to his regiment because General Terry had applied
for him. I know that he (Custer) felt tenderly and affectionately
toward him. On that day he hunted me out in the house and brought
me into the living-room, not telling me why. He shut the door, and
very seriously and impressively said: ‘General Terry, a man usually
means what he says when he brings his wife to listen to his statements.
I want to say that reports are circulating that I do not want to go out
to the campaign under you.’ (I supposed that he meant, having been
given the command before, he was unwilling to be a subordinate.)
‘But I want you to know that I do want to go and serve under you, not
only that I value you as a soldier, but as a friend and a man.’ The
exact words were the strongest kind of a declaration that he wished
him to know he wanted to serve under him.”</p>

<p class='c022'>That was Custer all over. And to any one who knew him—to any
one who can form a reasonable conception of the kind of a man he
must needs have been to have done for eighteen years what he had
done and as he had done it, and won the place and fame he had won—that
statement ends debate. Whatever of chagrin, disappointment,
or irritation he may have felt before, however unadvisedly the sore-hearted,
high-spirited man may have spoken with his lips when all was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>undetermined, and his part and responsibility had not been assigned,
this true soldier, knowing the gossip of the camp, conscious possibly it
was not wholly without cause, however exaggerated, but facing now
his known duty and touched by the confidence of his superior as Custer
never failed to be touched, could not part from his commander with
a possible shadow resting between them. He knew the speech of men
might have carried to Terry’s mind the suggestion of a doubt. And
yet Terry had trusted him. He could not bear to part without letting
General Terry know that he was right to trust him. That statement to
Terry was a recognition of whatever folly of words he might before
have committed in his grief and anger; it was an open purging of an
upright soldier’s soul as an act honorably due alike to superior and
subordinate; it was, under the circumstances, the instinctive response
of a true man to the confidence of one who had committed to him a
trust involving the honor and fame of both. Disobedience, whether
basely premeditated, or with equal baseness undertaken upon after-deliberation,
is inconceivable, unless one imputes to Custer a character
void of every soldierly and manly quality. With such an one discussion
would be useless.</p>

<p class='c022'>Upon the discussion itself, which is presented in the narrative and in
the appendix, I have little to say. In the opening paragraph of the
appendix, you say: “I presume the problem ... will never
be authoritatively settled, and that men will continue to differ upon
these questions until the end of time.”</p>

<p class='c022'>In other words, the charge of disobedience can never be proved.
The proof does not exist. The evidence in the case forever lacks the
principal witness whose one and only definite order was to take his
regiment and go “in pursuit of the Indians whose trail was discovered
by Major Reno a few days since.” They were the objective; they
were to be located and their escape prevented. That was Custer’s
task. All the details were left, and necessarily left, to his discretion.
All else in the order of June 22d conveys merely the “views” of the
commander to be followed “unless you should see sufficient reasons
for departing from them.” The argument that Custer disobeyed this
order seems to resolve itself into two main forms. One is trying to
read into the order a precision and a peremptory character which are
not there and which no ingenuity can put there, and to empty it of a discretion
which is there and is absolute; the other is in assuming or
asserting that Custer departed from General Terry’s views without
“sufficient reasons.” And this line of argument rests in part upon the
imputation to Custer of a motive and intent which was evil throughout,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>and in part upon what his critic, in the light of later knowledge and the
vain regrets of hindsight, thinks he ought to have done, and all in utter
ignorance of Custer’s own views of the conditions in which, when he
met them, he was to find his own reasons for whatever he did or did
not do. Under that order, it was Custer’s views of the conditions
when they confronted him that were to govern his actions, whether they
contravened General Terry’s views or not. If in the presence of the
actual conditions, in the light of his great experience and knowledge in
handling Indians, he deemed it wise to follow the trail, knowing it
would reach them, and deeming that so to locate them would be the
best way to prevent their escape, then he obeyed that order just as
exactly as if, thinking otherwise, he had gone scouting southward
where they were not, and neither Terry nor he expected
them to be.</p>

<p class='c022'>To charge disobedience is to say that he wilfully and with a wrong
motive and intent did that which his own military judgment forbade;
for it was his own military judgment, right or wrong, that was to govern
his own actions under the terms of that order. The quality of his
judgment does not touch the question of obedience. If he disobeyed
that order, it was by going contrary to his own judgment. That was
the only way he could disobey it. If men differ as to whether he did
that, they will differ.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>VI.</h4>

<p class='c020'>To sum up, I suggest this as a possible line of investigations by which
the student may determine the question for himself:</p>

<p class='c000'>First. Were Terry’s written orders definite and explicit?</p>

<p class='c000'>Second. Were they intelligent orders capable of execution?</p>

<p class='c000'>Third. Did these orders admit of more than one meaning?</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourth. What are the various meanings, if more than one?</p>

<p class='c000'>Fifth. Did Custer carry them out in any of their meanings?</p>

<p class='c000'>Sixth. Did Custer depart from them?</p>

<p class='c000'>Seventh. If so, how far?</p>

<p class='c000'>Eighth. Such being the case, was he justified in so departing by the
exigencies of the situation?</p>

<p class='c000'>Ninth. Were the consequences of such a departure serious?</p>

<p class='c000'>Tenth. Did Custer receive verbal orders from Terry at the last
moment?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Eleventh. If so, when?</p>

<p class='c000'>Twelfth. Did these verbal orders supersede the written orders?</p>

<p class='c000'>In closing, I repeat that I should be glad to be convinced that I have
erred in my conclusions; and that if any one can convince me that
Custer did not disobey, or that in doing so he was justified in his disobedience,
I shall make the fullest public amends for my expression
of opinion that he did and that he was not.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c007'><sup>[135]</sup></a>

I shall consider the establishment of that affidavit as settling the
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject is now left with the student. Perhaps I cannot more
fitly close the discussion than by this quotation from the confidential
report of General Terry by General Sheridan, dated July 2, 1875:</p>

<p class='c022'>“I do not tell you this to cast any reflection on Custer, for whatever
errors he may have committed he has paid the penalty, and you cannot
regret his loss more than I do; but I felt that our plan must have been
successful had it been carried out, and I desire you to know the facts.”</p>

      <div class='line'>My Dear Madam:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I have received and read and reread your letter of the 12th inst. That letter and
the thought of Mrs. Custer, whose character, in common with all Americans, I respect
and admire, taken in connection with the position which my conscience, much against
my will, has compelled me to assume, has filled me with deep regret.</p>

<p class='c022'>Having read thus far, you will undoubtedly divine that I am compelled to say that I
believe General Custer did disobey his orders. I have nowhere stated that I consider
him guilty of rashness. I have also made it plain, I think, that even though he did disobey
his orders, the ultimate annihilation of his battalion was due to the cowardice or
incapacity of Major Reno.</p>

<p class='c022'>I remember to have seen General Custer when I was a boy in Kansas. My father,
who was a veteran of the Civil War, had a great admiration for him. I was present
when the bodies of the officers of the Seventh Cavalry were brought back for reinterment
at Fort Leavenworth. My wife, a Southern woman, is a cousin of the late
General Dod Ramseur, who was General Custer’s intimate friend. The family have
never forgotten General Custer’s kindness when Ramseur was killed.</p>

<p class='c022'>I did, and still have, a warm admiration for the brilliant and soldierly qualities of
General Custer. He was, and is, my beau ideal of a cavalry soldier. When I began to
write these articles, I would not hear the charge that he had disobeyed orders. But I
have been compelled by my investigations to take that position. I cannot tell you how
painful it has been to me, and it is, to come to this conclusion. I have thought long
and deeply over the matter.</p>

<p class='c022'>Of course I read General Hughes’ now famous article. I did not, however, allow
that article alone to determine me; but I carefully considered every account. I examined
every discussion which I could find. Not only that, I corresponded with a number
of officers, among them being Lieutenant-General Miles, Major-General Hughes,
Brigadier-General C. A. Woodruff, Brigadier-General Carrington, and Colonel Godfrey.
The remarks of these officers were submitted to one another. Their statements
were weighed and digested with the utmost care by me. I could come to no other
conclusion than that I have arrived at.</p>

<p class='c022'>As an Appendix I have inserted in full my correspondence with different officers concerning
the matter. I have been glad to print all that Colonel Godfrey, who has indeed
been a powerful advocate in opposition to my views, has written. I have called
attention to one significant fact which, in my opinion, would fully clear General Custer
from the charge of disobedience. That is the affidavit of an alleged witness to the last
conversation between Terry and General Custer.</p>

<p class='c022'>General Miles refers to this affidavit in his book, “Personal Recollections of General
Nelson A. Miles.” President E. Benjamin Andrews also refers to it in his book, “The
United States in our Own Time.” I wrote to President Andrews, who gave Miles as
his authority. I wrote to General Miles <em>three times</em>, registering the last letter, asking
him to substantiate the affidavit, the existence of which was doubted by many army
officers. General Miles has made no reply. I take it for granted, therefore, that <em>he
cannot substantiate the affidavit</em>.</p>

<p class='c022'>I have said frankly that if he can prove this affidavit and establish the credibility of
the affiant, I will make public amends in the most ample manner for having said
General Custer disobeyed his orders. I have said that if <em>anybody</em> can convince me
that I have been wrong in my conclusion; if any evidence can be produced which
will establish the contrary, I shall be most happy to retract what I have said in any
possible way that may be suggested to me.</p>

<p class='c022'>I beg you to believe that I have written in no spirit of animosity to General Custer.
My real feelings for General Custer can easily be seen from my article on the Battle of
the Washita, to which you have referred. It would be most agreeable to me if you
would forward this letter to Mrs. Custer.</p>

<p class='c022'>Again deploring the unfortunate conclusion I am conscientiously compelled to arrive
at, and regretting more than I can express that I must give pain to Mrs. Custer, to
you, and to the friends of General Custer, I am,</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>APPENDIX B<br /> <span class='large'>Further Light on the Conduct of Major Reno</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>After the publication of the Custer article censuring Reno,
my attention was called to the following editorial, which
appeared in the <cite>Northwestern Christian Advocate</cite>, of September
7, 1904:</p>

<h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Why General Custer Perished</span></h4>

<p class='c020'>General George A. Custer was and will always be regarded as one of
the most brilliant officers of the United States Army. His career
abounds in romantic interest; and his death, together with that of
every officer and soldier fighting with him, was one of the most tragic
and memorable incidents in Indian warfare. The story of Custer’s
last fight with the Indians, which took place on the Little Big Horn
River in the summer of 1876, is graphically described by Cyrus Townsend
Brady. It is not our purpose to relate the story of the battle, but
to call attention to the real cause of Major Reno’s conduct, which
resulted in Custer’s defeat and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>After describing the movements by which Custer distributed his
force, and the task assigned to Major Reno, who displayed remarkable
indecision and errors of judgment, which would have been inexcusable
even in an inexperienced young officer, and caused Reno to retreat
instead of vigorously attacking the Indians, Mr. Brady says:</p>

<p class='c022'>“His [Reno’s] second position was admirable for defense. Sheltered by the
trees, with his flanks and rear protected by the river, he could have held the place
indefinitely. He had not, however, been detailed to defend or hold any position,
but to make a swift, dashing attack; and after a few moments of the feeblest kind
of advance, he found himself thrown upon the defensive. Such a result would break
up the most promising plan. It certainly broke up Custer’s.</p>

<p class='c022'>“It is a painful thing to accuse an army officer of misconduct, but I have taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the opinion of a number of army officers on the subject, and every one of them considers
Reno culpable in a high degree. One, at least, has not hesitated to make
known his opinion in the most public way. I am loath to believe that Major Reno
was a coward; <em>but he certainly lost his head, and when he lost his head he lost Custer</em>.
His indecision was pitiful. Although he had suffered practically no loss and had no
reason to be alarmed, he was in a state of painful uncertainty as to what he should
do next. The soldier—like the woman—who hesitates in an emergency which
demands instant decision is lost....</p>

<p class='c022'>“There had, as yet, been no panic, and under a different officer there would have
been none; but it is on record that Reno gave an order for the men to mount and
retreat to the bluffs. Before he could be obeyed he countermanded this order.
Then the order was given again, but in such a way that nobody, save those immediately
around him, heard it because of the din of the battle then raging in a sort of
aimless way all along the line, and no attempt was made to obey it. It was then
repeated for the third time. Finally, as those farthest away saw those nearest the
flurried commander mounting and evidently preparing to leave, the orders were
gradually communicated throughout the battalion and nearly the whole mass got
ready to leave. Eventually they broke out of the timber in a disorderly column of
fours, striving to return to the ford they had crossed when they had entered the
valley.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Reno calls this a charge, and he led it! He was so excited that, after firing
his pistols at the Indians, who came valiantly after the fleeing soldiers, he threw
them away. The pressure of the Indians upon the right of the men inclined them
to the left, away from the ford. In fact, they were swept into a confused mass and
driven toward the river. All semblance of organization was lost in the mad rush
for safety. The troops had degenerated into a mob.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Reno was not a coward, as many believe. His career in the
army during the Civil War and his promotion for gallant and meritorious
services at Kelley’s Ford, March 17, 1863, and at the battle of
Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864, are evidence of his courage. What,
then, was the explanation of his conduct at the Battle of the Little Big
Horn? Dr. Brady does not give it. Perhaps he does not know. But
Major Reno himself told the late Rev. Dr. Arthur Edwards, then editor
of the <cite>Northwestern</cite>, that his strange actions were due to the fact
that HE WAS DRUNK. Reno’s conduct in that battle lost him many
of his military friends. To Arthur Edwards, who knew him well, and
continued his faithful friend, Major Reno often unburdened his heart,
and on one occasion in deep sorrow said that his strange actions were
due to drink, and drink ultimately caused his downfall. His action at
the Battle of the Little Big Horn was cited as one instance of the result
of his use of intoxicating liquor. Liquor finally caused his expulsion
from the army in disgrace. In 1880 he was found guilty, by a general
court-martial, of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.
While in an intoxicated condition he engaged in a brawl in a public
billiard saloon, in which he assaulted another officer, destroying property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>and otherwise conducted himself disgracefully. For this offense
the court sentenced him to be dismissed from the army.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<p class='c000'>It had occurred to me that probably the explanation of Reno’s conduct
lay in the fact that he might have been intoxicated. I asked
Colonel Godfrey if he thought so, and his reply has been noted above
in Appendix A.</p>

<p class='c000'>After reading the article in the <em>Advocate</em>, I wrote to the editor, Dr.
David D. Thompson, asking for further evidence of the statement
quoted. Here follows his letter:</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My Dear Sir:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Doctor Arthur Edwards, the former editor of the <cite>Northwestern
Christian Advocate</cite>, was chaplain in the army during the Civil
War. He was a soldier by instinct, and kept up his interest in military
and naval affairs and his acquaintance with army and naval officers
during all his life. In the army he won the confidence of his fellow-officers
by his character and moral courage.</p>

<p class='c022'>He was requested, by a number of officers, to wait upon General
Hooker, then in command of the army, and express to him the
great anxiety felt by the officers over his intemperate habits.
Doctor Edwards waited upon General Hooker, and told him
what the officers had requested him to say. He did it in so manly
and delicate a way that General Hooker thanked him, and told him
the army would not again have occasion to fear ill results because
of his habits.</p>

<p class='c022'>The story of this incident came to the knowledge of Mr. H. I. Cleveland,
an editorial writer on the Chicago <em>Herald</em>, who published it several
years ago over his own name in that paper. I had never before
heard the story from Doctor Edwards, and when I saw Mr. Cleveland’s
article I asked Doctor Edwards about it. He related the story to me,
and, after doing so, told the story of Reno as I give it briefly in the
<cite>Northwestern</cite>.</p>

<p class='c022'>From all that I can learn of Reno, the feeling in the army against him
was not due to his drinking habits, but to his conduct in his relations
with others. Doctor Edwards told me that Reno told him that all of his
trouble in his contact with his fellow-officers was due, primarily, to his
drinking habits, which had undermined his moral character. Doctor
Edwards knew Reno very well, and told me he believed that drinking
was, as Reno himself stated, the cause of all his trouble. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>known him in the army during the Civil War, and spoke highly of his
character as a soldier at that time.</p>

<p class='c022'>P. S.—Doctor Edwards intended at some time to publish this story,
but died in April, 1901, before doing so.</p>

<h4 class='c019'>II.</h4>

<p class='c020'>As I have always been most willing and anxious to give the accused
a hearing in every case, it gives me great pleasure to insert here a letter
recently received from Mr. William E. Morris, an attorney, who is also
an alderman of Greater New York. In this letter will be found a
spirited defense of Major Reno, with interesting details of his fight.
Although Mr. Morris dissents from many of my conclusions, and
differs radically from the printed accounts of Colonel Godfrey and
others, I am glad to place the other side before my readers. I only
regret that this paper was received too late to be included in the body
of the book.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Sir:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I have read your article entitled “War with the Sioux,” and as a
survivor of Reno’s Battalion desire to enter an earnest protest against
the many incorrect statements of alleged facts.</p>

<p class='c022'>Col. Reno was cruelly libeled while he was alive, and took his medicine
manfully, knowing that he had the respect of every officer and enlisted
man who served under him on the 25th and 26th days of June, 1876.</p>

<p class='c022'>The 7th Cavalry had no use for cowards, and had Reno showed the
white feather, he would have been damned by every member of his
command.</p>

<p class='c022'>As a matter of fact, we revere his memory as that of a brave and gallant
officer, who, through circumstances over which he had no control,
was blamed by the public, who had no personal knowledge of the facts
for the result of the Battle of the Little Horn.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is quite evident to me that you have never interviewed a single
member of Reno’s Battalion, to wit: Troops “A,” “G,” and “M,”
for if you had you would not misstate the facts, as I assume that you
intend to be fair, and would not intentionally mislead the public mind.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c007'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>I was a member of Capt. Thomas H. French’s Troop “M,” 7th
U. S. Cavalry, and I submit the following as a concise statement of the
facts:</p>

<p class='c022'>We lost sight of Custer, whose command was on our right, at least
thirty minutes before we crossed the Little Horn River.</p>

<p class='c022'>We saw a party of about one hundred Indians before we reached the
river; we pursued them across the Little Horn and down the valley.
As soon as we forded, Reno gave the command, “Left into line, gallop—forward,
guide, center,” and away we went faster than I had ever
ridden before. The Indians rode as fast as they could, and the battalion
in line of battle after them. A body of at least two thousand came up
the valley to meet the one hundred or more we were pursuing. They
immediately made a flank movement to our left and a stand, opened a
galling fire, causing some of our horses to become unmanageable. John
R. Meyer’s horse carried him down the valley through the Indians,
some of whom chased him two or three miles over the hills and back to
ford. He escaped with a gun-shot wound in the neck. Rutten’s horse
also ran away, but he succeeded in making a circle before reaching
the Indians, and received only a gun-shot wound in the shoulder. We
were then abreast the timber; to continue the charge down the valley
meant (to the mind of every one) immediate destruction of the battalion,
which consisted of about one hundred and twenty men (the old
guard, of ten men from each troop, being with the packs).</p>

<p class='c022'>Reno, very properly, gave the command “Battalion halt—prepare
to fight on foot—dismount!” He directed French to send ten men
from the right of his troop to skirmish the woods, before the “numbers
four” proceeded there with the horses. We immediately deployed as
skirmishers and opened fire. The odds were at least thirty to one, as
our line with the fours out did not exceed seven officers and ninety men.
We had, however, a few Indian scouts and civilians. We had entire
confidence in our officers and in ourselves, and went to work smiling
and as cool as if we were at target practice. In less time than it takes
to relate it, the Indians were on three sides of us. We were ordered to
lie down, and every man that I could see, except Reno and French,
were fighting lying down. Reno walked along the line giving instructions
to the men, while French was calling his men’s attention to
his own marksmanship with an infantry long-tom that he carried.</p>

<p class='c022'>While in this position, the man next on my right, Sergeant O’Hara,
was killed. The smoke obscured the line, but bullets were taking effect
all along it. We were perfectly cool, determined, and doing good execution
and expected to hear Custer attack. We had been fighting lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>down about fifteen minutes when one of our men came from the timber
and reported that they were killing our horses in the rear. Every
troop had, at this time, suffered loss and the enemy was closing in, despite
our steady and deadly fire. Reno then made his only error; he
gave the command, “Retreat to your horses, men!” French immediately
corrected the mistake with the command, “Steady, men—fall
back, slowly; face the enemy, and continue your fire.” “M” troop
fell back slowly and in perfect order, held the Indians in check until
“A” and “G” had mounted. Several of their horses had been shot,
and their riders, consequently, very much disturbed.</p>

<p class='c022'>“M” Troop left Sergeant O’Hara and Private Smith on the skirmish
line. Isaiah, the colored interpreter of Fort Rice, Bloody Knife,
the Chief of the Rees Scouts, and a civilian also remained. Lawrence
was hit in the stomach when about to mount. I went to his relief,
which caused me to be the last man to leave the timber, with the command,
with the exception of Lieutenant Hare, who passed me in the
bottom. Sergeant Charles White was wounded in the arm and his
horse killed. He was left in the woods, as was also “Big Fritz,” a Norwegian,
whose surname I do not remember, but whose horse was
killed. “A” and “G” had men left in the timber also, and they all
reached the command on the hill during the night with De Rudio, or
about the same time.</p>

<p class='c022'>I give more details in regard to “M” than the other troops, because
of a personal acquaintance with each member. Corporal Scollen and
Private Sommers fell in the charge from the timber to the ford. It was
a charge and not a retreat, and it was led by Reno. Every man that I
saw used his revolver at close range. I was at least twenty yards behind
the rear of the command. The Indians closed in, so I was compelled
to jump my horse off the bank, at least fifty yards below the
ford, and while in the river had an excellent view of the struggle. It
was hand to hand, and McIntosh was certainly there at the ford and
sold his life as dearly as he possibly could. When I reached the cut in
bank, I found Turley and Rye mounted and Lieutenant Hodgson
wounded and dismounted. He was waist-deep in the water. He
grasped my off stirrup strap with both hands. Rye let Turley go ahead
through the cut, and he was killed as he reached the top; Rye followed
without receiving a scratch. The lieutenant held onto my stirrup for
two or three seconds, and was dragged out of the water. He was hit
again, and let go as my horse plunged up the cut. Sergeant Criswell
may have assisted him out of the water, but if he did he went back into
it again. To say that any man could or did ride back down that cut is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>to suggest, to my mind, the impossible. Upon reaching the level above
the cut I dismounted and led my horse as fast as possible up the bluff,
and overtook Tinker, Bill Meyer and Gordon about half way up the
bluff. We stopped a moment to rest. The bodies of the fallen soldiers
were plainly visible. They marked the skirmish line and the line
of the charge from the timber to the ford, and were in the river and at
the top of the cut. At this instant a shower of lead sent Meyer and
Gordon to the happy hunting-ground, and a fifty caliber passed
through the left breast of your humble servant. Our horses were also
hit. I continued up the hill alone and joined the command; was
then assisted to the improvised hospital.</p>

<p class='c022'>Reno at this time had lost, in killed, wounded, and left dismounted
in the woods, over 30 per cent. of his battalion (there were over ten
left in the woods). Lieutenant Hare was particularly conspicuous,
and distinguished himself by his cool and determined manner when he
ordered the men to fall in at the top of the hill, and whatever demoralization
there was, was immediately dispelled by that courageous
young Texan. Benteen, arriving about an hour later, came up as
slow as though he were going to a funeral. By this statement I do not
desire to reflect in any way upon him; he was simply in no hurry; and
Müller, of his troop, who occupied an adjoining cot to mine in the hospital
at Fort Abraham Lincoln, told me that they walked all the
way, and that they heard the heavy firing while they were watering
their horses.</p>

<p class='c022'>Benteen was, unquestionably, the bravest man I ever met. He held
the Indians in absolute contempt, and was a walking target from the
time he became engaged until the end of the fight at sundown on the
26th. He took absolute charge of one side of the hill, and you may
rest assured that he did not bother Reno for permission of any kind.
He was in supreme command of that side of the hill, and seemed to enjoy
walking along the line where the bullets were the thickest. His
troop, “H,” did not dig rifle-pits during the night of the 25th, as the
other troops did, and in the morning their casualties were increased
on that account. He ordered “M” out of their pits to reinforce his
troop. There was some dissatisfaction at the order, as the men
believed that the necessity was due solely to the neglect of “H,” in
digging pits. They obeyed, however, and assisted Benteen in his
famous charge.</p>

<p class='c022'>It was rumored, subsequently, that French recommended his First
Sergeant, John Ryan, a sharpshooter, and some other men for medals,
and that Benteen refused to indorse the recommendation as to Ryan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>because he failed immediately to order the men out of their pits at his
end of the line at his (Benteen’s) order. It was claimed that French
thereupon withdrew his list. Ryan was in charge of the ten men
that Reno sent to skirmish the woods.</p>

<p class='c022'>I was very much amused to learn, from your article, that Windolph
received a medal. I remember him as the tailor of “H” troop, and
have a distinct recollection of his coming into the field-hospital, bent
almost double and asking for treatment for a wound which, his appearance
would suggest, was a mortal one, but which the surgeon
found, on removing his trousers, to be only a burn. The surgeon ordered
him back to the line amid a shout of laughter from the wounded
men. Mike Madden of “K” lost his leg, and Tanner of “M” his
life, in the dash for the water for the wounded. I hope Madden
received a medal.</p>

<p class='c022'>In view of the conflict between the foregoing and the statements contained
in your article, I ask you to investigate the matter further, with a
view to correcting the false impression that your readers must have
concerning Reno and his command. In conclusion, I ask you “how,
in God’s name,” you could expect Reno, with one hundred and
twenty men, to ride through upwards of three thousand armed Sioux,
and then be of assistance to Custer or any one else? I say we were
sent into that valley and caught in an ambush like rats in a trap. That
if we had remained ten minutes longer, there would not have been one
left to tell the tale. That the much abused Reno did charge out of
the timber, and that we who survive owe our lives to that identical
charge which he led. We, at least, give him credit for saving what he
did of his command. I am, sir,</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
